# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

Each operation allows us to pick an edge and XOR both its endpoints with `k`. Since the tree is connected, we can perform any even number of XORs on any subset of nodes, but an odd number of XORs must be applied to an even number of nodes (since each operation affects two nodes). The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after any number of such operations.

For each node, we can choose to either:
- Leave it as is, or
- XOR it with `k` (possibly multiple times, but XORing twice returns it to the original value).

The optimal strategy is to XOR a subset of nodes with `k` such that the sum is maximized, but the number of nodes XORed must be even (since each operation affects two nodes).

### Approach

- For each node, compute the value after XORing with `k` and compare it to the original value.
- If XORing increases the value, we want to XOR that node.
- However, since we can only XOR an even number of nodes, if the number of nodes where XORing increases the value is odd, we must skip the node with the smallest absolute difference between its original and XORed value.
- Calculate the sum by taking the maximum of the original and XORed value for each node.
- If the number of nodes XORed is odd, subtract the smallest difference from the sum to ensure the number of XORed nodes is even.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumValueSum(int[] A, int k, int[][] edges) {
        long res = 0;
        int d = 1 << 30, c = 0;
        for (int a : A) {
            int b = a ^ k;
            res += Math.max(a, b);
            c ^= a < b ? 1 : 0;
            d = Math.min(d, Math.abs(a - b));
        }
        return res - d * c;
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a few variables are used.

### Summary

- The solution greedily chooses to XOR nodes where it increases their value, but ensures the number of XORed nodes is even.
- If the number is odd, it undoes the smallest gain to make the count even.
- This approach is efficient and optimal for the given constraints.
