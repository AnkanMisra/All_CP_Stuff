# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

For each node `i` in the first tree, we want to connect it to some node in the second tree such that the number of nodes within distance `k` from `i` is maximized.  
The problem can be broken down into:
- For each node in tree 1, count how many nodes are within distance `k` from it.
- For each node in tree 2, count how many nodes are within distance `k-1` from it (since one edge is used to connect the trees).
- The answer for node `i` in tree 1 is its own count plus the maximum count from any node in tree 2.

### Approach

- **Build Adjacency Lists:** Represent both trees using adjacency lists.
- **DFS for Forward Paths:**
  - For each tree, perform a DFS to compute `dp[v][d]`, the number of descendants of `v` at distance `d`.
- **DFS for Backward Paths (Backtracking):**
  - For each tree, perform another DFS (or use a topological order from the first DFS) to compute `backtrack[v][d]`, the number of nodes at distance `d` from `v` by going through its parent.
- **Count Total Paths:**
  - For each node `v`, `count[v]` is the sum of `dp[v][d]` and `backtrack[v][d]` for all `d <= k`.
- **Combine Results:**
  - Find the maximum `count2[v]` among all nodes in tree 2.
  - For each node `i` in tree 1, the answer is `count1[i] + maxConnectivity` (where `maxConnectivity` is the max from tree 2).

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxTargetNodes(int[][] edges1, int[][] edges2, int k) {
        final int N = edges1.length + 1;
        final int M = edges2.length + 1;
        if (k == 0) {
            int[] res = new int[N];

        int maxConnectivity = 1;
        for (int count : count2)
            maxConnectivity = Math.max(maxConnectivity, count);
        for (int v = 0; v < N; v++)
            count1[v] += maxConnectivity;
        return count1;
    }

    private List<Integer>[] buildAdj(int[][] edges, int vertexCount) {
        List<Integer>[] tree = new List[vertexCount];
        int u, v;
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            u = edge[0];
            v = edge[1];
            if (tree[u] == null) tree[u] = new LinkedList<Integer>();
            if (tree[v] == null) tree[v] = new LinkedList<Integer>();
            tree[u].add(v);
            tree[v].add(u);

        return tree;
    }

    private void dfs(int v, int p, List<Integer>[] adj, int[] parent, int[][] dp, Queue<Integer> q, int k) {

            return;
        for (int d = 1; d <= k; d++)
            dp[p][d] += dp[v][d - 1];
    }

    private void calcBacktrack(Queue<Integer> q, int[] parent, int[][] dp, int[][] backtrack, int[] count, int k) {
        int v, p;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {

                count[v] += dp[v][d] + backtrack[v][d];
            }
        }

}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * k + M * k), where N and M are the number of nodes in the trees.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * k + M * k), for the DP and backtrack arrays.

### Summary

- The solution uses DFS to compute the number of nodes within distance `k` (or `k-1`) for each node in both trees.
- It considers both forward paths (to descendants) and backward paths (through parent).
- The final answer for each node in tree 1 is its own count plus the maximum count from any node in tree 2.
