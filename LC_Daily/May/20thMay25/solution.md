# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

To determine if we can transform the array into a Zero Array using the given queries, we need to check if every element in `nums` can be decremented to zero or below by the queries that cover its index. The optimal way is to decrement every possible index in each query, so we need to count how many times each index is covered by all queries.

### Approach

- Use a difference array (`counts`) to efficiently track the number of times each index is covered by the queries.
- For each query `[l, r]`, increment `counts[l]` by 1 and decrement `counts[r + 1]` by 1 (since the end index is inclusive).
- Compute the prefix sum of `counts` to get the total number of times each index can be decremented.
- For each index, if `nums[i]` is greater than the total decrements possible at that index, return `false`.
- If all elements can be decremented to zero or below, return `true`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isZeroArray(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int[] counts = new int[nums.length + 1];
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            counts[query[0]]++;
            counts[query[1] + 1]--; // +1 because the end index is inclusive
        }

        int sum = 0; // sum counts the max possible decrements at a given index in nums
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            sum += counts[i];

            // if at any point nums[i] is greater than sum, that means it would not be
            // possible to return a zero, so we return false.
            if (nums[i] > sum) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + q), where n is the length of `nums` and q is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the difference array.

### Summary

- The solution uses a difference array to efficiently count the number of times each index is covered by the queries.
- It checks if each element can be decremented to zero or below.
- This approach is optimal and efficient for large input sizes.
