# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that for any element at position `i`, we need to find all possible OR values that can be formed by subarrays ending at position `i`. Since OR operations can only **add bits** (never remove them), the number of distinct OR values for subarrays ending at any position is **limited by the number of bits** in the maximum possible value.

## Approach
We use a **dynamic programming approach** with the following strategy:

1. **Maintain a set of possible OR values** for subarrays ending at the current position
2. For each new element, **extend all previous OR values** by performing OR operation with the current element
3. **Add the current element itself** as a new possible OR value (single element subarray)
4. **Collect all unique OR values** encountered throughout the process

The crucial observation is that when we extend subarrays ending at position `i-1` to position `i`, we get at most **32 distinct OR values** (since integers have at most 32 bits), making this approach efficient.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty set to store all **distinct OR values** encountered
2. Initialize a set `current` to store OR values of subarrays ending at the current position
3. For each element `num` in the array:
   - Create a new set `next` for OR values ending at current position
   - Add `num` itself to `next` (single element subarray)
   - For each OR value `val` in `current`:
     - Add `val | num` to `next` (extend previous subarrays)
   - Add all values from `next` to the global result set
   - Update `current = next`
4. Return the **size of the result set**

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * 32)` where `n` is the length of the array
  - For each element, we process at most 32 distinct OR values
  - The number 32 comes from the maximum number of bits in an integer
- **Space Complexity:** `O(32 * n)` in the worst case
  - We store at most 32 distinct OR values per position
  - The result set can contain at most `32 * n` distinct values

## Summary
This approach works because **OR operations are monotonic** - they can only add bits, never remove them. This property limits the number of distinct OR values we need to track at each position, making the solution efficient despite considering all possible subarrays. The key optimization is recognizing that we don't need to explicitly generate all subarrays, but can instead **propagate OR values** from previous positions.
