# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The main idea is to efficiently count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums1[i] + nums2[j] == tot` after a series of updates to `nums2`. Since `nums1` is small and `nums2` can be very large, we use hash maps to store the frequency of elements in both arrays, allowing for fast pair counting and efficient updates.

## Approach
- **Initialization:**
  - Store the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
  - Build a frequency map for `nums1` (`map1`) and for `nums2` (`map2`).
- **add(index, val):**
  - Decrease the count of the old value at `nums2[index]` in `map2`.
  - Update `nums2[index]` by adding `val`.
  - Increase the count of the new value in `map2`.
- **count(tot):**
  - For each unique value `x` in `nums1`, check if `tot - x` exists in `map2`.
  - If it does, add `map1[x] * map2[tot - x]` to the result, since each occurrence of `x` in `nums1` can pair with each occurrence of `tot - x` in `nums2`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**
  - `add`: `O(1)` (hash map update)
  - `count`: `O(M)`, where `M` is the number of unique elements in `nums1` (at most `1000`)
- **Space Complexity:**
  - `O(M + N)`, where `M` is the number of unique elements in `nums1` and `N` is the number of unique elements in `nums2`

## Summary
- **Efficient frequency maps** allow for fast updates and queries.
- The approach leverages the small size of `nums1` for quick pair counting.
- All operations are efficient even for large `nums2` due to the use of hash maps.
- Handles all edge cases, including repeated values and multiple updates to the same index.
