# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
Since Alice may have **pressed a key for too long at most once**, we need to count all possible original strings she could have intended. The key insight is that each **consecutive group of identical characters** represents a potential location where Alice might have held a key too long. For each such group of length `n`, we can **remove 1, 2, ..., or n-1 characters** to get different possible original strings.

## Approach
The solution uses a **greedy counting approach**:

1. **Initialize counter**: Start with `count = 1` to account for the original string as-is
2. **Iterate through the string**: Use two pointers to identify consecutive groups of identical characters
3. **Count group sizes**: For each group, calculate its length `n`
4. **Add possibilities**: If `n > 1`, add `(n-1)` to the total count, representing the number of ways to reduce this group
5. **Move to next group**: Continue until all characters are processed

The algorithm recognizes that if there are `n` consecutive identical characters, there are `n-1` ways Alice could have intended fewer characters in that position (by removing 1, 2, ..., up to n-1 characters).

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string, as we traverse the string once
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables

## Summary
This approach works because it **systematically counts all valid reductions** that Alice could have made. Since she pressed a key too long **at most once**, we can consider reducing any single group of consecutive identical characters. The total count is the sum of reduction possibilities for each group plus the original string. The solution handles **edge cases** naturally: if no consecutive identical characters exist, only the original string is possible (count = 1).
