# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The core idea is to model the tree and precompute **subtree XOR values** to efficiently calculate the XOR of components formed by removing edges. By rooting the tree and using timestamps, we can determine subtree relationships and compute the required XOR differences for all possible pairs.

## Approach
1. Build an **adjacency list** representation of the tree.
2. Perform a **DFS** to compute the XOR value of each subtree and assign in/out timestamps for ancestor checks.
3. Compute the **total XOR** of all node values.
4. Enumerate all pairs of non-root nodes (each pair corresponds to removing edges to their subtrees).
5. For each pair, determine the three component XORs based on whether one subtree is nested within the other or they are disjoint.
6. Calculate the score as the difference between the max and min of these XORs, and track the minimum score.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** `O(n^2)` due to enumerating all pairs of nodes and constant-time XOR calculations per pair.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)` for the adjacency list, XOR array, and timestamp arrays.

## Summary
This approach efficiently computes the required scores by leveraging precomputed subtree XORs and ancestor relationships, ensuring we cover all possible ways to split the tree into three components while minimizing the score. Key considerations include handling nested and disjoint subtrees correctly and optimizing for the given constraints (`n <= 1000`).
