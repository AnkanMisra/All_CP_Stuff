# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to use a **greedy approach** that processes positions from left to right while tracking the **most restrictive conflicting pairs**. Instead of trying all possible pair removals, we can efficiently calculate the optimal result by maintaining the top two left boundaries that would restrict subarrays ending at each position.

For each position `r`, we count valid subarrays ending at `r` by considering which conflicting pairs would prevent certain starting positions. The algorithm also calculates **bonus values** that represent the additional subarrays we gain by removing specific conflicting pairs.

## Approach
The strategy uses a **single-pass greedy algorithm** with the following key components:

1. **Group conflicting pairs** by their right endpoint for efficient processing
2. **Track top two left boundaries** that most restrict subarrays at each position
3. **Calculate base answer** by counting valid subarrays without removing any pair
4. **Compute bonus values** for each potential pair removal
5. **Return sum** of base answer and maximum bonus

For each position `r` from 1 to `n`:
- Update the top two most restrictive left boundaries from conflicting pairs ending at `r`
- Add `r - left[0]` valid subarrays ending at position `r`
- Calculate bonus value for removing the most restrictive pair

## Algorithm
1. **Initialize data structures**:
   - `right[i]` stores left endpoints of conflicting pairs with right endpoint `i`
   - `left[2]` tracks the two largest left boundaries seen so far
   - `bonus[i]` accumulates bonus value for removing pairs with left endpoint `i`

2. **Process each position** `r` from 1 to `n`:
   - For each conflicting pair ending at `r`, update top two left boundaries
   - Add `r - left[0]` to the base answer (valid subarrays ending at `r`)
   - If `left[0] > 0`, add `left[0] - left[1]` to `bonus[left[0]]`

3. **Find maximum bonus** across all positions and return `base_answer + max_bonus`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + k)` where `n` is the array length and `k` is the number of conflicting pairs. We process each position once and each conflicting pair once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n + k)` for storing the grouped conflicting pairs and bonus arrays.

## Summary
This **greedy approach** is much more efficient than exhaustive enumeration because it recognizes that we only need to track the **most restrictive constraints** at each position. The bonus calculation cleverly determines how much we gain by removing each conflicting pair without explicitly trying all removals. The algorithm works because removing a conflicting pair can only increase the number of valid subarrays, and the optimal choice is the one that provides the maximum bonus.
