# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that for a subsequence to be valid, the parity (even or odd) of the sum of every two consecutive elements must be the same throughout the subsequence. This means that as we build the subsequence, we need to ensure that the parity of the sum of each adjacent pair remains consistent.

## Approach
- We use **dynamic programming** to keep track of the longest valid subsequence ending with a particular parity.
- Define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[a][b]` represents the length of the longest valid subsequence ending with two numbers of parity `a` and `b` (where `a` and `b` are `0` for even and `1` for odd).
- For each number `x` in `nums`, compute its parity `r = x % 2`.
- For both possible previous parities (`y = 0` and `y = 1`), update `dp[r][y]` as `dp[y][r] + 1` (extending the best subsequence ending with `y` and `r` by adding `x`).
- Keep track of the maximum value in `dp` as the answer.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

## Summary
- The approach works because it efficiently tracks the best possible valid subsequence for each parity combination using dynamic programming.
- Only the parity of the last two elements matters for extending the subsequence, so we only need a small fixed-size DP table.
- This method ensures we always find the longest valid subsequence, regardless of the input sequence.
