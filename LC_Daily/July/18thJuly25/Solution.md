# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to split the array into three equal parts and remove `n` elements such that the difference between the sum of the first `n` and the next `n` elements (after removal) is minimized. To achieve this, we need to efficiently track the smallest possible sum for the first part and the largest possible sum for the second part, after removing any valid subsequence of `n` elements.

## Approach
- Let `n` be the size of each part (`nums.length = 3 * n`).
- We want to remove any `n` elements so that the remaining `2 * n` elements, when split into two consecutive parts of size `n`, have the minimum possible difference between their sums.
- To do this efficiently:
  - **Left Side:** For each possible split point, maintain the sum of the `n` smallest elements from the left up to that point. Use a **max-heap** to always keep the smallest `n` elements and their sum as we move from left to right.
  - **Right Side:** For each possible split point, maintain the sum of the `n` largest elements from the right up to that point. Use a **min-heap** to always keep the largest `n` elements and their sum as we move from right to left.
- For every valid split (where the left and right parts are both of size `n`), compute the difference between the sum of the left part and the sum of the right part. Track the minimum such difference across all splits.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
  - Each heap operation takes `O(log n)`, and we perform `O(n)` operations for both left and right traversals.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We use two heaps of size at most `n` and two arrays of size `n` for prefix and suffix sums.

## Summary
- The approach works by efficiently maintaining the optimal sums for both parts using heaps, allowing us to consider all possible ways to remove `n` elements and split the array.
- The use of heaps ensures that we always have the best possible candidates for the smallest and largest sums as required.
- This method guarantees the minimum possible difference between the two parts after removal, and handles large input sizes efficiently due to its `O(n log n)` complexity.
