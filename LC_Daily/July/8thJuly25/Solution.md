# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to select up to `k` non-overlapping events to maximize the total value. Since events can overlap, we need to efficiently decide which events to attend and which to skip, considering both their values and their time intervals.

## Approach
- **Sort the events** by their end day to make it easier to find the latest non-overlapping event for any given event.
- Use **dynamic programming** where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value by considering the first `i` events and attending at most `j` events.
- For each event, we have two choices:
  - **Skip the current event:** The value remains the same as `dp[i-1][j]`.
  - **Attend the current event:** Find the latest event that ends before the current event starts (using binary search for efficiency), and add the current event's value to the best solution for one fewer event (`dp[prev+1][j-1] + value`).
- For each event and each possible number of attended events (up to `k`), take the maximum of these two choices.
- The answer is the maximum value in `dp[n][k]` after processing all events.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * k * log n)`
  - Sorting events: `O(n log n)`
  - For each event and each `k`, binary search for the previous non-overlapping event: `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * k)`
  - For the dynamic programming table.

## Summary
This approach efficiently combines **dynamic programming** and **binary search** to maximize the total value from up to `k` non-overlapping events. By sorting events and using a DP table, we ensure that each decision (attend or skip) is optimal, and binary search allows us to quickly find the best previous event to attend. This method handles large constraints and overlapping intervals effectively.
