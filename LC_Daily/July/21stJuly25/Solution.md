# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
- The key insight is that a **fancy string** cannot have three or more consecutive identical characters. We need to **keep at most two consecutive occurrences** of any character.

## Approach
- Iterate through the string from left to right, keeping track of the count of consecutive identical characters.
- For each character, if it is the same as the previous one, increment the count; otherwise, reset the count to 1.
- **Only add the character to the result if the count is less than or equal to 2**. This ensures that no three consecutive characters are the same.
- Build the result string as we go.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`, for storing the result string.

## Summary
- By **tracking consecutive characters** and only allowing up to two in a row, we efficiently construct a fancy string with the minimum deletions.
- This approach is optimal and handles all edge cases, including strings with no triples and strings where all characters are the same.
