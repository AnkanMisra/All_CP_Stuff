# Problem: Find the Original Typed String II

## Problem Description
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may **press a key for too long**, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string `word`, which represents the **final output displayed on Alice's screen**. You are also given a positive integer `k`.

Return the **total number of possible original strings** that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of **size at least k**.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo 10^9 + 7**.

## Input Format
- `word`: A string representing the final output on Alice's screen
- `k`: A positive integer representing the **minimum size** of the original string

## Output Format
- An integer representing the **total number of possible original strings** modulo **10^9 + 7**

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `word = "aabbccdd", k = 7`<br/>
**Output:** `5`<br/>
**Explanation:** The possible strings are: `"aabbccdd"`, `"aabbccd"`, `"aabbcdd"`, `"aabccdd"`, and `"abbccdd"`.

### Example 2
**Input:** `word = "aabbccdd", k = 8`<br/>
**Output:** `1`<br/>
**Explanation:** The only possible string is `"aabbccdd"`.

### Example 3
**Input:** `word = "aaabbb", k = 3`<br/>
**Output:** `8`

## Constraints
- `1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `word` consists only of **lowercase English letters**
- `1 <= k <= 2000`

## Notes
The problem involves finding all possible original strings where **consecutive identical characters** in the final output could have been typed with fewer repetitions, as long as the resulting string has **at least k characters**.
