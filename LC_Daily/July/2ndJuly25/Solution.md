# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that Alice's **typing errors only involve pressing keys too long**, which means she can only **add extra characters**, not remove or change them. When we see consecutive identical characters in the final output, we know that in the original string, there could have been **fewer repetitions** of that character (but at least one).

For example, if we see `"aaa"` in the output, the original could have been `"a"`, `"aa"`, or `"aaa"`. This gives us **multiple choices** for each group of consecutive characters, leading to a **combinatorial counting problem**.

## Approach
The solution uses **dynamic programming** with the following key steps:

1. **Group consecutive characters**: First, identify all groups of consecutive identical characters in the input string. For example, `"aabbccdd"` becomes groups: `[(a,2), (b,2), (c,2), (d,2)]`.

2. **Calculate minimum possible length**: For each group of length `len`, we must keep **at least 1 character** in the original string. So the minimum possible original string length is the **number of groups**.

3. **Dynamic programming state**: Use `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of ways to form strings of length `j` using the first `i` groups of characters.

4. **Transition**: For each group of length `len`, we can choose to keep anywhere from `1` to `len` characters. This gives us `len` choices for each group.

5. **Count valid combinations**: Sum up all `dp[total_groups][length]` where `length >= k` to get the final answer.

## Algorithm
1. **Parse the input**: Group consecutive identical characters and store their counts
2. **Initialize DP table**: Create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents ways to achieve length `j` using first `i` groups
3. **Base case**: `dp[0][0] = 1` (one way to make empty string with zero groups)
4. **Fill DP table**: For each group `i` with length `group_len`:
   - For each possible length `j` we can achieve so far
   - For each choice `choice` from `1` to `group_len`:
     - Update `dp[i+1][j + choice] += dp[i][j]`
5. **Sum results**: Add all `dp[total_groups][length]` where `length >= k`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k * max_group_size)` where `n` is the number of character groups, `k` is the minimum length constraint, and `max_group_size` is the largest consecutive character group
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)` for the DP table

## Summary
This approach works because it **systematically considers all possible original strings** by making independent choices for each group of consecutive characters. The **dynamic programming ensures we don't double-count** any possibilities, and the **modular arithmetic** handles large numbers efficiently.

**Key insights:**
- Each group of consecutive characters provides **multiple independent choices**
- We need to ensure the **total length constraint** `>= k` is satisfied
- The problem reduces to a **counting DP** where we track both the number of groups processed and the current string length
- **Corner cases** include when `k` is larger than the input string length (answer is 0) or when `k` equals the minimum possible length (we need to count carefully)
