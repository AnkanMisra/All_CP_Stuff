# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that the string grows in a **binary tree-like pattern** where each operation doubles the length. Instead of building the actual string, we can use **bit manipulation** to determine how many **alphabet transformations** a character at position `k` has undergone.

The string lengths follow powers of 2: `1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → ...`. Each character can be thought of as having a **"depth" or "level"** that determines how many times it has been transformed from the original `'a'`.

## Approach
The algorithm works **backwards from position k** to determine the transformation count:

1. **Find the highest power of 2** less than or equal to `k` using bit manipulation
2. **Subtract this power of 2** from `k` to get the relative position in the previous generation
3. **Increment the transformation counter** since we've moved up one level in the binary tree
4. **Repeat until we reach position 1** (the base case)
5. **Return the character** by adding the transformation count to `'a'`

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `ans = 0` (transformation counter) and temporary variable `t`
2. While `k != 1`:
   - Find the position of the most significant bit: `t = 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(k)`
   - If `k` is exactly a power of 2, decrement `t` to get the previous power
   - Subtract `(1 << t)` from `k` to get position in previous generation
   - Increment `ans` to count one more transformation
3. Return `(char)('a' + ans)`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log k)` - The algorithm processes each bit position of `k` at most once
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - Only uses a constant amount of extra space

## Summary
This approach **avoids building the actual string** by recognizing the **binary tree structure** of the problem. Each position `k` can be mapped to a specific transformation level through bit manipulation. The algorithm efficiently determines how many alphabet shifts have been applied to reach position `k`, making it much faster than simulating the string construction process.

**Key insight:** The position of a character in the final string directly corresponds to its transformation count, which can be calculated using the binary representation of its index.
