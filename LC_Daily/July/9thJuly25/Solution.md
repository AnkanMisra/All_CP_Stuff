# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The main idea is to maximize the longest continuous free time during the event by rescheduling at most `k` meetings. Since meetings must remain non-overlapping and in order, we can only shift their start times within certain bounds. The problem reduces to finding the largest possible gap (free time) that can be created by optimally rescheduling up to `k` meetings.

## Approach
- **Prefix Sums:** Compute the total duration of all meetings and prefix sums to efficiently calculate occupied time up to any meeting.
- **Binary Search:** Use binary search on the answer (`g` = maximum free time) to check if it is possible to achieve at least `g` free time by rescheduling at most `k` meetings.
- **Feasibility Check:** For each possible gap (before the first meeting, after the last meeting, and between meetings), check if it is possible to create a free interval of at least `g` by shifting up to `k` meetings. This is done using:
  - Checking the gap before the first meeting and after the last meeting.
  - Sliding window and monotonic queue to efficiently check all possible intervals between meetings where up to `k` meetings can be rescheduled.
- **Edge Case:** If `k == n`, all meetings can be rescheduled anywhere, so the answer is simply the event time minus the total meeting duration.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log eventTime)` — Each binary search step takes `O(n)` time, and binary search runs in `O(log eventTime)` steps.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — For prefix sums and auxiliary arrays.

## Summary
- The approach works by combining binary search with efficient interval checking using prefix sums and monotonic queues.
- The key insight is that the problem can be reduced to checking if a gap of size `g` can be created by rescheduling up to `k` meetings, and this can be checked efficiently for all possible positions.
- Handles edge cases where all meetings can be rescheduled, and ensures meetings remain non-overlapping and in order.
