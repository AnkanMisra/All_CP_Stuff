# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The **maximum possible bitwise OR** of any subset is achieved by ORing all elements in the array together, since OR operations can only add bits, never remove them. Once we know this maximum value, we need to count how many subsets can achieve this maximum OR value using **backtracking** to explore all possible subset combinations.

## Approach
The solution uses a **two-step approach**:

1. **Find Maximum OR**: Calculate the maximum possible bitwise OR by ORing all elements in the array together.

2. **Count Valid Subsets**: Use **recursive backtracking** to generate all possible subsets and count those that achieve the maximum OR value.

For each element in the array, we have **two choices**:
- **Include** the element in the current subset (OR it with current OR value)
- **Exclude** the element from the current subset (keep current OR value unchanged)

We recursively explore both choices and count subsets that result in the maximum OR value.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `maxOr = 0` and iterate through all elements to find maximum possible OR
2. Call recursive function `backtrack(nums, 0, 0, maxOr)` starting from index 0 with current OR = 0
3. In backtracking function:
   - **Base case**: If we've processed all elements, return 1 if current OR equals maximum OR, else 0
   - **Recursive case**: Try both excluding and including current element
   - Return sum of counts from both choices
4. Return total count of valid subsets

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)` where `n` is the length of the array, as we explore all possible subsets
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the recursion stack depth

## Summary
This **backtracking approach** works because it systematically explores all possible subset combinations while maintaining the current OR value. The key insight is that the maximum OR is always the OR of all elements, and we only need to count subsets that achieve this maximum. The solution handles all edge cases naturally, including arrays with duplicate elements and single-element arrays.
