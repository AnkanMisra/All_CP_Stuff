# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` can only be eliminated by each other, so they will always win their matches until they meet. The round in which they meet depends on how the other matches are resolved, which can be chosen to either bring them together as soon as possible (earliest) or keep them apart as long as possible (latest).

## Approach
- Model the tournament as a recursive process where, in each round, the two best players advance and the rest of the matches can be resolved arbitrarily.
- Use recursion with memoization to explore all possible ways the two players can be paired in each round, tracking the minimum and maximum rounds in which they can meet.
- At each round:
  - If `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are paired, return the current round.
  - Otherwise, simulate all possible positions they can occupy in the next round, considering the outcomes of other matches.
- Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations for the same state (`n`, `a`, `b`).

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)` (since the number of states is bounded by the number of players and their positions)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^3)` (for memoization of states)

## Summary
- The solution uses **recursion with memoization** to simulate all possible tournament outcomes, always ensuring the two best players win until they meet.
- By exploring all possible match outcomes for other players, we can determine both the **earliest** and **latest** rounds in which the two best players can compete.
- The approach efficiently handles the small constraint (`n <= 28`) and guarantees correct results by considering all valid scenarios for the two players' advancement.
