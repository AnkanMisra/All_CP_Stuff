# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The **key insight** is that the maximum possible bitwise AND of any subarray will always be the **maximum element** in the array. This is because the bitwise AND operation can only **decrease or maintain** the value - it never increases it. Therefore, the maximum AND value achievable is when we have a subarray containing only the maximum elements.

## Approach
The solution works in **two phases**:

1. **Find the maximum value** in the entire array - this will be our target AND value `k`
2. **Find the longest contiguous sequence** of elements equal to this maximum value

Since we need subarrays with AND equal to `k` (the maximum value), and AND operations only decrease values, the only way to achieve this is to have subarrays containing **only the maximum elements**.

## Algorithm
1. **Iterate through the array** to find the maximum value `maxVal`
2. **Iterate through the array again** and track:
   - `currentLength`: length of current contiguous sequence of `maxVal`
   - `maxLength`: maximum length seen so far
3. **For each element**:
   - If it equals `maxVal`, increment `currentLength` and update `maxLength`
   - If it doesn't equal `maxVal`, reset `currentLength` to 0
4. **Return** the `maxLength`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array (two passes through the array)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` using only constant extra space

## Summary
This approach works because the **maximum bitwise AND** of any subarray is constrained by the largest element present. Since AND operations can only decrease values, the optimal strategy is to find the **longest contiguous sequence of maximum elements**. The solution handles all edge cases naturally, including arrays with a single element or arrays where all elements are the same.
