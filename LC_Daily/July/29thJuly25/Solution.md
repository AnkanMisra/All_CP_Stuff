# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that **bitwise OR only increases or stays the same** when we add more elements to a subarray. For each starting position `i`, we need to find the **shortest subarray** that achieves the **maximum possible OR** from that position. Since OR can only increase, the maximum OR from position `i` is achieved by taking the OR of all elements from `i` to the end of the array.

However, we don't need to extend the subarray all the way to the end. We only need to extend it until we've **captured all the bits** that contribute to the maximum OR. The solution tracks the **latest occurrence of each bit** and finds the farthest position needed to include all relevant bits.

## Approach
The algorithm processes the array from **right to left** and maintains a `latest` array that tracks the **most recent position** where each bit (0 to 31) was set to 1.

1. **Initialize tracking array**: Create a `latest` array of size 32 (for 32 bits) and fill it with -1
2. **Process from right to left**: For each position `i` from `n-1` to 0:
   - **Update bit positions**: For each bit position `b` from 0 to 31, if bit `b` is set in `nums[i]`, update `latest[b] = i`
   - **Find farthest required position**: Initialize `farEle = i`, then for each bit position, if `latest[b] != -1`, update `farEle = max(farEle, latest[b])`
   - **Calculate subarray length**: The minimum subarray length starting at `i` is `farEle - i + 1`

## Algorithm
1. Create `result` array of size `n` and `latest` array of size 32 filled with -1
2. Iterate from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`:
   - Set `farEle = i` (initially, the subarray contains only the current element)
   - For each bit position `b` from 0 to 31:
     - If bit `b` is set in `nums[i]`, update `latest[b] = i`
     - If `latest[b] != -1`, update `farEle = max(farEle, latest[b])`
   - Set `result[i] = farEle - i + 1`
3. Return the `result` array

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(32 * n)` = `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once and for each element, we check 32 bit positions.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` excluding the output array, as we only use a fixed-size array of 32 elements to track bit positions.

## Summary
This approach works because **bitwise OR is monotonic** - it never decreases when adding elements. By processing from right to left and tracking the latest occurrence of each bit, we can efficiently determine the minimum subarray length needed to achieve the maximum OR from each starting position. The algorithm ensures we capture all necessary bits while minimizing the subarray length. **Key insight**: we only need to extend the subarray until we've included the farthest position that contributes a unique bit to the maximum OR.
