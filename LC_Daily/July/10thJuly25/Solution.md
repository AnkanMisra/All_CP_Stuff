# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that by rescheduling at most one meeting, we can potentially create a larger continuous free interval during the event. Since meetings are non-overlapping and sorted, moving one meeting to a different free slot (while keeping its duration and not overlapping others) can maximize the largest gap between meetings.

## Approach
- **Calculate all free intervals** between meetings, as well as before the first and after the last meeting.
- For each meeting, consider two options:
  - **Remove** the meeting from its current position, which merges the free intervals before and after it into a larger gap.
  - **Reschedule** the meeting into the largest available free interval elsewhere, as long as it fits without overlapping.
- For each possible rescheduling, compute the maximum free time that can be achieved.
- Track the best possible result across all meetings.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

## Summary
By analyzing the effect of removing or moving each meeting, we can efficiently determine the maximum possible continuous free time. The approach leverages the sorted, non-overlapping nature of the meetings and only requires a single pass to compute the best rescheduling option. This ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.
