# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that **two folders are identical if their subfolder structures (including all descendants) are exactly the same**. By representing the folder structure as a tree (trie), we can uniquely serialize each subtree and identify duplicates by their serialization.

## Approach
- **Build a trie** to represent the folder structure, where each node is a folder and its children are subfolders.
- **Serialize each subtree**: For every node, recursively generate a string that uniquely represents its subfolder structure. This serialization includes the folder names and the serialization of their children, sorted lexicographically.
- **Count subtree serializations**: Use a map to count how many times each unique subtree serialization appears in the trie.
- **Mark duplicates**: Any subtree serialization that appears more than once indicates duplicate folders. Mark these nodes and all their descendants for deletion.
- **Prune the trie**: Traverse the trie again and remove all subtrees that are marked as duplicates.
- **Collect the remaining paths**: Perform a traversal to collect all remaining folder paths in the trie.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N * L)` where `N` is the number of paths and `L` is the average length of a path. Each node is visited a constant number of times, and serialization is efficient due to sorting only direct children.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N * L)` for storing the trie and the serialization map.

## Summary
By **serializing each subtree** and using a map to detect duplicates, we can efficiently identify and remove all duplicate folders and their subfolders in a single pass. The approach ensures that only the originally marked duplicates are deleted, and no further deletions occur after the first pass, as required by the problem statement. This method handles all edge cases, including deeply nested and lexicographically unordered folders, by always sorting children during serialization.
