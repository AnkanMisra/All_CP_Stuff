# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that we **don't need to simulate the entire string construction** process, which would be impossible given the constraint `k <= 10^14`. Instead, we can **trace backwards** from position `k` to determine what character would be at that position.

Each operation doubles the string length, creating a **binary tree-like structure** where:
- Operation 0: duplicates the current string (left half = right half)
- Operation 1: duplicates and increments each character in the right half

The character at position `k` depends on **which path we take** through this binary structure and **how many increment operations** affect that position.

## Approach
The solution uses a **reverse binary search approach** to trace the path from position `k` back to the root:

1. **Calculate the starting level**: Find the operation level `i` where position `k` would be located using `Math.ceil(Math.log(k) / Math.log(2))) - 1`

2. **Trace backwards through operations**: For each level from `i` down to 0:
   - Check if `k` is in the **right half** of the current level using `k > (1L << i)`
   - If in the right half and `operations[i] == 1`, **increment the character count** (since operation 1 increments characters in the right half)
   - **Adjust position**: Subtract `(1L << i)` from `k` to map to the corresponding position in the left half
   - Move to the previous level by decrementing `i`

3. **Calculate final character**: The character at position `k` is `'a'` shifted by `count % 26` positions, where `count` represents the total number of increments applied

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log k)` - We trace back through at most `log k` levels of operations
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` - Only using a constant amount of extra space for variables

## Summary
This approach works because each operation creates a **predictable pattern** in the binary structure. By tracing backwards from position `k`, we can determine exactly how many increment operations affect that position without building the entire string. The key insight is that **position relationships are preserved** across operations, allowing us to map any position back to the original character 'a' plus the accumulated increments. This handles the **large constraint efficiently** and correctly manages the **alphabet wrapping** from 'z' to 'a'.
