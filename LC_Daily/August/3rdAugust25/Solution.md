# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to use a **sliding window approach** with two pointers to efficiently explore all possible contiguous segments of fruit positions that can be reached within `k` steps. Since we can move left or right from the starting position, the optimal strategy involves visiting a **contiguous range of fruit positions** and calculating the minimum steps needed to collect all fruits in that range.

## Approach
The solution uses a **two-pointer sliding window technique** where:
- `left` and `right` pointers define the current window of fruit positions being considered
- For each window, we calculate the **minimum steps required** to visit all positions in the range
- The minimum steps formula considers two strategies: **start from leftmost and end at rightmost**, or **start from rightmost and end at leftmost**
- We expand the window by moving `right` pointer and shrink it by moving `left` pointer when the step count exceeds `k`
- Track the **maximum sum of fruits** collected in any valid window

## Algorithm
1. Initialize two pointers `left = 0`, `right = 0`, and variables for `sum` and `ans`
2. Expand the window by incrementing `right` and adding `fruits[right][1]` to the current sum
3. While the current window requires more than `k` steps:
   - Remove `fruits[left][1]` from the sum
   - Increment `left` to shrink the window
4. Update the maximum answer with the current sum
5. Repeat until `right` reaches the end of the array
6. The step calculation uses: `min(|startPos - rightPos|, |startPos - leftPos|) + (rightPos - leftPos)`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the fruits array. Each element is visited at most twice (once by right pointer, once by left pointer)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space

## Summary
This approach works because it systematically examines all possible **contiguous segments** of fruit positions that can be reached within the step limit. The sliding window technique ensures we don't miss any optimal solution while maintaining efficiency. The key insight is that the optimal path will always involve collecting fruits from a contiguous range of positions, and the step calculation accounts for the most efficient way to traverse that range from the starting position.
