# Problem: Fruits Into Baskets III

## Problem Description
You are given two arrays of integers, **fruits** and **baskets**, each of length `n`, where `fruits[i]` represents the **quantity** of the `i`th type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the **capacity** of the `j`th basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:
- Each fruit type must be placed in the **leftmost available basket** with a capacity **greater than or equal** to the quantity of that fruit type.
- Each basket can hold **only one** type of fruit.
- If a fruit type **cannot be placed** in any basket, it remains **unplaced**.

Return the **number of fruit types** that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

## Input Format
- `fruits`: An array of integers representing the quantity of each fruit type.
- `baskets`: An array of integers representing the capacity of each basket.

## Output Format
Return an integer representing the number of fruit types that remain unplaced.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]`<br/>
**Output:** `1`<br/>

**Explanation:**
- `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.
- `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.
- `fruits[2] = 5` cannot be placed in `baskets[2] = 4`.
- Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return `1`.

### Example 2
**Input:** `fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]`<br/>
**Output:** `0`<br/>

**Explanation:**
- `fruits[0] = 3` is placed in `baskets[0] = 6`.
- `fruits[1] = 6` cannot be placed in `baskets[1] = 4` (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, `baskets[2] = 7`.
- `fruits[2] = 1` is placed in `baskets[1] = 4`.
- Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return `0`.

## Constraints
- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 10^9`
