# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that any positive integer `n` can be **uniquely represented as a sum of powers of 2** using its binary representation. Each bit position that is set to 1 corresponds to a power of 2 that should be included in the `powers` array. Once we have this array, we can answer range product queries by multiplying the elements in the specified range.

## Approach
1. **Extract powers of 2:** Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation and collect all powers of 2 that sum to `n`. This is done by checking each bit position and adding the corresponding power of 2 when the bit is 1.

2. **Store in array:** Store these powers of 2 in a list in **ascending order** (which naturally happens as we process bits from least significant to most significant).

3. **Process queries:** For each query `[left, right]`, multiply all elements in the `powers` array from index `left` to `right` (inclusive), taking modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to prevent overflow.

4. **Handle modular arithmetic:** Since the product can be very large, we use modular multiplication throughout the computation.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty list `bins` to store powers of 2
2. Set `rep = 1` (represents current power of 2)
3. While `n > 0`:
   - If `n % 2 == 1`, add `rep` to `bins`
   - Divide `n` by 2 and multiply `rep` by 2
4. For each query `[left, right]`:
   - Initialize `cur = 1`
   - For each index `j` from `left` to `right`:
     - Multiply `cur` by `bins[j]` and take modulo `10^9 + 7`
   - Store result in answer array

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n + Q * R)` where `Q` is the number of queries and `R` is the average range size. The `log n` comes from extracting powers of 2, and `Q * R` comes from processing all queries.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` for storing the powers of 2 array, since there are at most `log n` bits in the binary representation.

## Summary
This approach works because **every positive integer has a unique binary representation**, which directly gives us the minimum set of powers of 2 that sum to `n`. The solution efficiently extracts these powers and processes range product queries using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. The key insight is leveraging the binary representation to avoid complex factorization.
