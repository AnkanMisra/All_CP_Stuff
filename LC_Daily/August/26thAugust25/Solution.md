# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To find the rectangle with the **longest diagonal**, we need to calculate the diagonal length for each rectangle using the **Pythagorean theorem**: `diagonal = sqrt(length² + width²)`. Since we want to avoid floating-point calculations, we can compare the **squared diagonal lengths** instead. If multiple rectangles have the same longest diagonal, we choose the one with the **maximum area**.

## Approach
The solution involves iterating through all rectangles and tracking two key metrics:
1. **Maximum squared diagonal length** seen so far
2. **Maximum area** among rectangles with the current longest diagonal

For each rectangle:
- Calculate the **squared diagonal length** (`length² + width²`)
- Calculate the **area** (`length × width`)
- If the squared diagonal is **greater** than the current maximum, update both the maximum diagonal and area
- If the squared diagonal **equals** the current maximum, update the area only if it's larger

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `maxDiagonalSquared = 0` and `maxArea = 0`
2. For each rectangle in `dimensions`:
   - Extract `length = dimensions[i][0]` and `width = dimensions[i][1]`
   - Calculate `diagonalSquared = length * length + width * width`
   - Calculate `area = length * width`
   - If `diagonalSquared > maxDiagonalSquared`:
     - Update `maxDiagonalSquared = diagonalSquared`
     - Update `maxArea = area`
   - Else if `diagonalSquared == maxDiagonalSquared` and `area > maxArea`:
     - Update `maxArea = area`
3. Return `maxArea`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of rectangles, as we iterate through the array once
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space

## Summary
This approach works by **avoiding floating-point arithmetic** through squared diagonal comparisons while maintaining the correct ordering. The key insight is that if `a² > b²` then `a > b` for positive numbers, so comparing squared diagonals gives the same result as comparing actual diagonals. The algorithm handles the **tie-breaking condition** correctly by prioritizing maximum area when diagonal lengths are equal.
```java
class Solution {
    public int areaOfMaxDiagonal(int[][] dimensions) {
        int maxDiagonalSquared = 0;
        int maxArea = 0;

        for (int[] dimension : dimensions) {
            int length = dimension[0];
            int width = dimension[1];

            int diagonalSquared = length * length + width * width;
            int area = length * width;

            if (diagonalSquared > maxDiagonalSquared) {
                maxDiagonalSquared = diagonalSquared;
                maxArea = area;
            }
            else if (diagonalSquared == maxDiagonalSquared && area > maxArea) {
                maxArea = area;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
}

```
