# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that **two numbers can be rearranged to form each other if and only if they have the same digit frequency**. Instead of generating all permutations of the input number, we can compare the digit frequency of the input with the digit frequencies of all possible powers of 2.

## Approach
We use a **digit counting technique** where each digit's frequency is encoded as a power of 10. For any number, we calculate a unique "signature" that represents the count of each digit (0-9).

1. **Create a count function** that converts a number into a digit frequency signature
2. **Calculate the signature** for the input number `n`
3. **Iterate through all possible powers of 2** (from 2^0 to 2^30, since 2^30 > 10^9)
4. **Compare signatures**: If any power of 2 has the same signature as `n`, return `true`
5. If no match is found, return `false`

The `count` function works by adding `10^digit` for each digit in the number, creating a unique representation of digit frequencies.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n + 31 * log(2^30))` = `O(log n)` - We process each digit of `n` once, then check 31 powers of 2
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - Only using constant extra space for variables

## Summary
This approach works because **digit rearrangement is equivalent to having identical digit frequencies**. By encoding digit counts as powers of 10, we create unique signatures that can be quickly compared. The solution efficiently checks all relevant powers of 2 (up to 2^30) without generating permutations, making it both time and space efficient.
