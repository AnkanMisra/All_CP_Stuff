# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
Since the array is circular, every element is adjacent to the next one, and the last element is adjacent to the first. To find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, we need to check the difference for every pair of consecutive elements, including the pair formed by the last and first elements.

## Approach
- Iterate through the array.
- For each index `i`, compute the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[(i + 1) % nums.length]`.
- Keep track of the maximum difference found.
- Return the maximum difference after checking all pairs.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we check each adjacent pair once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.

## Summary
By checking the absolute difference between every pair of adjacent elements (including the circular pair), we efficiently find the maximum difference in a single pass through the array.
