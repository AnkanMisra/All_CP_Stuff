# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the lexicographically largest string that can be obtained from any split of the original string into `numFriends` non-empty parts. Since all split parts are put into a box, the largest possible string among all parts from all possible splits is the answer. The key insight is that the largest string will always be a substring that starts at a position with the largest character and is as long as possible, given the split constraints.

## Approach
- If `numFriends` is 1, the only possible split is the whole word, so return the word itself.
- Otherwise, for each possible split, the first part can end at any position from the first character up to the position where there are enough characters left to make the remaining `numFriends - 1` parts (each at least length 1).
- The lexicographically largest string will be the longest substring starting at a position with the largest character, and ending as late as possible, while still allowing the remaining splits.
- Iterate through the string to find the maximum character.
- For each occurrence of this character, consider the substring starting at this position and ending at the latest possible position that allows the remaining splits.
- Track the lexicographically largest such substring.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the word. This is because we scan the string a few times, but each scan is linear.
- Space Complexity: O(1) additional space, not counting the output string.

## Summary
The approach works because the lexicographically largest string from all possible split parts will always be a substring starting at the largest character and as long as possible, given the split constraints. By checking all such substrings efficiently, we ensure the correct answer in optimal time.
