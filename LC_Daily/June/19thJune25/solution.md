# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem requires partitioning the array into the minimum number of subsequences such that the difference between the maximum and minimum in each subsequence is at most k. The main insight is that, after sorting, we can greedily group consecutive numbers together as long as the difference between the smallest and largest in the current group does not exceed k.

## Approach
1. **Sort the Array:**  
   Sorting the array allows us to process numbers in increasing order, making it easy to group them optimally.
2. **Greedy Grouping:**  
   - Start with the first number as the beginning of the current group.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - If the difference between the current number and the start of the group is greater than k, start a new group and increment the count.
     - Otherwise, continue adding to the current group.
3. **Return the Result:**  
   The answer is the number of groups formed, which is count + 1 (since the first group is not counted in the loop).

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the array (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (ignoring the space used by sorting, which may be O(n) depending on the implementation).

## Summary
By sorting the array and greedily forming groups where the difference between the smallest and largest is at most k, we ensure the minimum number of subsequences. This approach is efficient and optimal for the given constraints.

```java
class Solution {
    public int partitionArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int count=0;
        int curr=nums[0];
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]-curr>k){
                count++;
                curr=nums[i];
            }
        }
        return count+1;
    }
}
