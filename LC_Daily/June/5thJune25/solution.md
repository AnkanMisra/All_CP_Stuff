# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest equivalent string for a given base string, using equivalence information from two other strings. The key insight is that all equivalent characters form groups, and for each character in the base string, we should replace it with the smallest character in its equivalence group.

## Approach
- Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure to group equivalent characters together.
- For each pair of characters at the same position in `s1` and `s2`, merge their groups.
- Always keep the smallest character as the representative (root) of each group to ensure lexicographical minimality.
- For each character in `baseStr`, find its group representative and replace it with the smallest character in its group.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize a parent array for all 26 lowercase English letters, where each character is its own parent.
2. For each index in `s1` and `s2`, union the groups of the corresponding characters.
   - When merging, always make the parent the lexicographically smaller character.
3. For each character in `baseStr`, find its group representative and use that as the replacement.
4. Construct and return the resulting string.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N + M), where N is the length of `s1`/`s2` and M is the length of `baseStr`. All union-find operations are nearly constant time due to path compression.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since the parent array size is fixed at 26.

## Summary
By using union-find and always merging groups towards the lexicographically smallest character, we ensure that every character in the base string is replaced by the smallest possible equivalent character, resulting in the lexicographically smallest equivalent string.
