# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

The problem is about collecting the maximum number of candies from boxes, where some boxes are initially open and others are locked. You can open new boxes if you find their keys or if you find them inside other boxes. The challenge is to simulate the process of opening boxes, collecting candies, and using keys and contained boxes efficiently.

### Approach

- Use a queue to process boxes that are currently open and available to be opened.
- Use a set to keep track of locked boxes that you have but cannot open yet.
- For each box you open:
  - Collect its candies.
  - For each key found inside, unlock the corresponding box. If you already have that box, add it to the queue.
  - For each contained box, if it is open, add it to the queue; otherwise, add it to the set of locked boxes.
- Continue this process until there are no more boxes to open.
- Return the total number of candies collected.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a queue with all initially open boxes and a set for locked boxes.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Pop a box from the queue.
   - Add its candies to the result.
   - For each key in the box, unlock the corresponding box and add it to the queue if you already have it.
   - For each contained box, add it to the queue if it is open, otherwise add it to the set of locked boxes.
3. Return the total candies collected.

### Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n + total number of keys + total number of contained boxes), where n is the number of boxes.
- Space Complexity: O(n), for the queue and sets.

### Summary

- The solution uses BFS to simulate the process of opening boxes, collecting candies, and using keys and contained boxes.
- It efficiently tracks which boxes are locked and which can be opened next.
- The approach ensures that all reachable candies are collected, and is optimal for the given constraints.
