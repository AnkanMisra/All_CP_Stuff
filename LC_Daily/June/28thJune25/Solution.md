# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is to find the subsequence of length `k` from the array `nums` that has the maximum possible sum, while maintaining the original order of elements. The key insight is to select the `k` largest elements (by value, not by index), but to preserve their original order in the array.

## Approach
1. **Count Frequencies of the k Largest Elements:**  
   - Use a TreeMap in reverse order to count the frequency of each number in `nums`.
   - Iterate through the map and keep only the top `k` elements (by value), adjusting their frequencies so that the total count is exactly `k`.
2. **Build the Result Subsequence:**  
   - Iterate through the original array.
   - For each element, if it is one of the selected top `k` elements (and its frequency is still positive), add it to the result and decrement its frequency.
   - Stop when the result has `k` elements.
3. **Return the Result:**  
   - The result is the maximum sum subsequence of length `k` in the original order.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the array (due to TreeMap operations).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the map and the result array.

## Summary
**By selecting the k largest elements and preserving their original order, we efficiently construct the maximum sum subsequence of length k.**  
This approach is optimal and maintains the required order.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] ans = new int[k];
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for(int n: nums) {
            map.put(n, map.getOrDefault(n, 0) + 1);
        }

        Set<Integer> set = map.keySet();
        int temp = k;
        for(int key: set) {
            int freq = map.get(key);
            if(freq <= temp) {
                temp -= freq;
            } else if(freq > temp) {
                map.put(key, temp);
                temp -= freq;
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(map.get(nums[i]) > 0) {
                ans[j++] = nums[i];
                map.put(nums[i], map.get(nums[i]) - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
