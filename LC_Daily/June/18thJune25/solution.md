## Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks us to divide an array `nums` into `n/3` subarrays of size 3. The condition for each subarray is that the difference between its maximum and minimum elements must be at most `k`. If multiple solutions exist, any is fine; if none, return an empty array.

To satisfy the condition `max_element - min_element <= k` for each group of three, it is always optimal to sort the array first. After sorting, if we pick three consecutive elements, say `[x, y, z]` where `x <= y <= z`, the condition `max_element - min_element <= k` simplifies to `z - x <= k`. This greedy strategy of taking consecutive elements from the sorted array is optimal because it minimizes the difference `z - x` for any group of three elements it creates, thus leaving more "room" or flexibility for subsequent groups.

## Approach
1.  **Sort the array**: Sort `nums` in ascending order. This is the critical first step for the greedy approach.
2.  **Iterate and Group**: Iterate through the sorted array, taking three elements at a time. Since `n` is a multiple of 3, this will naturally divide the array into `n/3` groups.
3.  **Check Condition**: For each group `[nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]]`:
    *   The largest element is `nums[i+2]` and the smallest is `nums[i]`.
    *   Check if `nums[i+2] - nums[i] > k`.
    *   If this condition is ever true for any group, it means it's impossible to satisfy the requirement for this specific group (and by extension, the entire array), so return an empty 2D array immediately.
4.  **Form Result**: If the condition is satisfied, add `[nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]]` to the result 2D array.
5.  **Return**: If the loop completes without returning an empty array, it means all groups satisfied the condition, so return the constructed 2D array.

## Why this greedy approach works (Proof Sketch)
Suppose there is an optimal solution `S` that does not group `nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]` (from the sorted array) together.
Consider the first group `G = {a, b, c}` (where `a < b < c`) in our greedy solution that violates `c - a > k`. Our algorithm would return `[]`.
If an optimal solution `S'` exists, it must group `a, b, c` with other elements.
Suppose `c` is grouped with `x, y` where `x, y < c`. Then `x` or `y` must be one of `nums[i], nums[i+1]`.
If `c` is grouped with `x, y`, then `c-x <= k`.
If `a, b` are grouped with `z`, then `z-a <= k` and `z-b <= k`.
Since `nums` is sorted, `nums[i]` is the smallest available element at its position. By taking `nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]`, we are minimizing the difference `max - min` for this specific group. If even this minimal difference `nums[i+2] - nums[i]` exceeds `k`, then any other grouping involving `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` with elements further to the right would only result in a larger minimum or maximum within the group, making `max - min` even larger. Therefore, if the greedy choice fails, no other choice can succeed for that triplet.

## Complexity
-   **Time Complexity**: O(N log N)
    *   `Arrays.sort(nums)` takes O(N log N).
    *   The loop iterates `N/3` times, with constant time operations inside. So, O(N).
    *   Total time complexity is dominated by sorting: O(N log N).
-   **Space Complexity**: O(N) or O(N/3)
    *   `res` 2D array stores `N` elements in total, so O(N).
    *   `Arrays.sort()` might use O(log N) or O(N) extra space depending on implementation.

## Summary
The problem is optimally solved by sorting the input array and then greedily forming groups of three consecutive elements. This strategy works because sorting ensures that picking adjacent elements always minimizes the difference within a group. If any such group fails the `k` difference condition, no valid division exists.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[][] divideArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array.
        // This is crucial for the greedy approach because it ensures that
        // consecutive elements are the closest to each other.
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        // Step 2: Initialize the result 2D array.
        // Since n is a multiple of 3, we'll have n/3 arrays, each of size 3.
        int[][] result = new int[nums.length / 3][3];

        // Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array, taking 3 elements at a time.
        // i will be the starting index of each triplet.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 3) {
            // For each triplet [nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]]:
            // The smallest element is nums[i].
            // The largest element is nums[i+2].

            // Step 4: Check the condition for the current triplet.
            // If the difference between the largest and smallest element is greater than k,
            // then this triplet cannot satisfy the condition.
            // Because the array is sorted, if this greedy choice fails, no other combination
            // involving these elements can succeed with a smaller difference.
            // Therefore, it's impossible to divide the entire array satisfying the condition.
            if (nums[i + 2] - nums[i] > k) {
                return new int[0][0]; // Return an empty 2D array
            } 
            
            // Step 5: If the condition is satisfied, add the triplet to the result.
            // The current triplet goes into the (i/3)-th row of the result array.
            result[i / 3][0] = nums[i];
            result[i / 3][1] = nums[i + 1];
            result[i / 3][2] = nums[i + 2];
        }

        // Step 6: If the loop completes, it means all triplets satisfied the condition.
        // Return the successfully formed 2D array.
        return result;
    }
}
