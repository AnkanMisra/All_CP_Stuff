# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To maximize the difference between two numbers obtained by remapping a digit, we should try all possible ways to replace one digit `x` with another digit `y` (for all `x` and `y` from 0 to 9), and keep track of the minimum and maximum valid results. The answer is the difference between the maximum and minimum.

## Approach
- For every possible digit `x` (0 to 9), and every possible digit `y` (0 to 9):
  - Replace all occurrences of `x` in the number with `y`.
  - If the resulting number does not have a leading zero, consider it as a valid candidate.
  - Track the minimum and maximum valid numbers obtained.
- Return the difference between the maximum and minimum.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(100 * n), where n is the number of digits in `num` (since there are 10 choices for `x` and 10 for `y`, and each replacement takes O(n)).
- Space Complexity: O(n), for the string representation of the number.

## Summary
By brute-forcing all possible digit remappings and filtering out numbers with leading zeros, we can efficiently find the maximum possible difference as required by the problem.
