# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To maximize the difference by remapping a digit, we want to:
- **Maximize** the number by replacing one digit with '9' (the largest possible digit).
- **Minimize** the number by replacing one digit with '0' (the smallest possible digit).

For the maximum, we should replace the first digit that is not already '9' with '9' everywhere it appears.  
For the minimum, we should replace the first digit (even if it's already '0') with '0' everywhere it appears.

## Approach
- Convert the number to a string for easy digit manipulation.
- For the maximum value:
  - Find the first digit that is not '9' and replace all its occurrences with '9'.
- For the minimum value:
  - Replace all occurrences of the first digit with '0'.
- Convert both resulting strings back to integers and return their difference.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of digits in the number, since we scan and replace digits at most twice.
- Space Complexity: O(n), for the string representations.

## Summary
By replacing the appropriate digits to maximize and minimize the number, and then taking their difference, we efficiently solve the problem as required.
