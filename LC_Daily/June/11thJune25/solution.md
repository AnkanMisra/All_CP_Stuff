# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the maximum difference between the frequency of two digits `a` and `b` in any substring of length at least `k`, where `a` has an odd frequency and `b` has an even frequency in that substring. Since the string only contains digits '0' to '4', we can try all possible pairs `(a, b)`.

## Approach
- For each pair of digits `(a, b)` (with `a != b`), use prefix sums to track:
  - The difference `D[i]` between the count of `a` and `b` up to position `i`.
  - The parity (odd/even) of the count of `a` and `b` up to position `i`.
  - The count of `b` up to position `i`.
- For each position, we want to find a previous position such that:
  - The substring from that position to the current position has length at least `k`.
  - The parity of `a` in the substring is odd, and the parity of `b` is even.
- Use a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently keep track of the minimum prefix difference for each combination of parities and count of `b`.
- For each position, update the Fenwick Tree with the current prefix information, and query it to find the best possible previous prefix that satisfies the parity and count conditions.
- The answer is the maximum difference found over all pairs `(a, b)` and all valid substrings.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n * 25), where n is the length of the string (since there are 5*5=25 pairs of digits).
- Space Complexity: O(n) for prefix arrays and Fenwick Trees.

## Summary
By iterating over all pairs of digits and using prefix sums and Fenwick Trees to efficiently track and query the required conditions, we can find the maximum difference for all valid substrings in the string.
