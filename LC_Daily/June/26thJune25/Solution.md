# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the length of the longest subsequence of a binary string `s` that forms a binary number less than or equal to `k`. The key insight is that zeros can always be included (since they don't increase the value), and ones can be included greedily from the right (least significant bit) as long as the resulting value does not exceed `k`.

## Approach
1. **Iterate from Right to Left:**  
   - Start from the end of the string (least significant bit).
2. **Include Zeros Freely:**  
   - Every '0' can be included in the subsequence, as it does not increase the value.
3. **Include Ones Greedily:**  
   - For each '1', check if including it (at its bit position) would keep the value â‰¤ k.
   - If yes, include it and update the current value.
   - If not, skip it.
   - Only consider up to 31 bits (since 2^31 > 10^9, which is the max value for k).
4. **Count the Included Characters:**  
   - The answer is the total number of included characters.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string (each character is processed once).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), only a few variables are used.

## Summary
**By including all zeros and as many ones as possible from the right (without exceeding k), we efficiently find the longest valid subsequence.**  
This greedy approach is optimal for the given constraints.

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        long currentValue = 0;
        int shift = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '0') {
                count++;
                shift++;
            } else {
                if (shift <= 30 && currentValue + (1L << shift) <= k) {
                    currentValue += (1L << shift);
                    count++;
                    shift++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
