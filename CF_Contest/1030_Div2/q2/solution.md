# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks us to transform an `n Ã— n` matrix, initially filled such that `A[i][j] = j`, into a state where every column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. We can achieve this by reversing subarrays within rows. The total number of operations must not exceed `2n`.

The core idea is to apply a systematic series of reversals to each row such that distinct numbers are moved to different columns across the rows. If we can make each row `i` contain the value `i` in some unique column position for each row, or more generally, make each column receive a distinct value from each row, then the permutation property will be satisfied.

## Approach
The provided solution implements a specific deterministic strategy to achieve the permutation in each column. It processes each row `i` from 1 to `n` and applies a set of reversals.

Let's trace the operations applied to a generic row `i`:

1.  **For Row 1 (`i = 1`)**:
    *   The entire row is reversed: `(1, 1, n)`.
    *   Initially, row 1 is `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
    *   After the operation, row 1 becomes `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

2.  **For Rows `i` from 2 to `n`**:
    The code applies two distinct reversal operations to row `i`:
    *   **Reverse the prefix**: `(i, 1, n - i + 1)`. This reverses the segment of elements from column 1 up to column `n - i + 1`.
    *   **Reverse the suffix**: `(i, n - i + 2, n)`. This reverses the segment of elements from column `n - i + 2` up to column `n`.

Let's illustrate the effect on a row `i` (initially `[1, 2, ..., n]`):
*   Initial row `i`: `[1, 2, ..., (n-i+1), (n-i+2), ..., n]`
*   After `(i, 1, n-i+1)`: `[(n-i+1), (n-i), ..., 1, (n-i+2), ..., n]` (The prefix is reversed)
*   After `(i, n-i+2, n)`: `[(n-i+1), (n-i), ..., 1, n, (n-1), ..., (n-i+2)]` (The suffix is reversed)

This strategy effectively shuffles the elements in each row `i > 1` in a specific way, combining a decreasing sequence with a decreasing sequence of the remaining larger numbers. Together with the first row's complete reversal, this ensures that each column eventually receives a distinct set of numbers.

## Algorithm

1.  Initialize an empty list `l` to store the operations.
2.  **Process Row 1**:
    *   Add the operation `(1, 1, n)` to `l`. This reverses the entire first row.
3.  **Process Rows 2 to `n`**:
    *   For `i` from `2` to `n`:
        *   Add the operation `(i, 1, n - i + 1)` to `l`. This reverses the initial segment of length `n - i + 1`.
        *   Add the operation `(i, n - i + 2, n)` to `l`. This reverses the remaining suffix of the row.
4.  **Output**:
    *   Print the total number of operations (`l.size()`).
    *   For each operation `Y(p, q, r)` in `l`, print `p q r`.

**Note on auxiliary code**: The `z(int x)` function and `Collections.shuffle(l, new Random(n))` are irrelevant to the correctness of the solution's logic as it aims for *any* valid sequence of operations. The core logic of generating operations is deterministic.

## Complexity

-   **Time Complexity**: O(n) per test case.
    *   The loop iterates `n` times. In each iteration, a constant number of operations are added to the list.
    *   The overall sum of `n` across all test cases is limited, so this is efficient enough.
-   **Space Complexity**: O(n) per test case.
    *   The `l` list stores `O(n)` operations (specifically, `1 + 2 * (n-1) = 2n - 1` operations).

## Summary
The solution provides a constructive algorithm that systematically reverses subarrays within each row. By fully reversing the first row and applying a pair of prefix-suffix reversals to subsequent rows, it strategically places numbers in columns to guarantee that each column eventually contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The total number of operations `(2n - 1)` adheres to the `2n` limit.

                // for i >= 2 and n >= 3, since prefixEndCol (n-i+1) will be >= 1 and < n.
