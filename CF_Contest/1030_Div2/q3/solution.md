# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks us to maximize the total "beauty" (sum of set bits in binary representation) of numbers in an array `a` by performing at most `k` increment operations. Each operation involves selecting an index `i` and increasing `a[i]` by 1. The total budget `k` can be very large, which suggests a greedy approach rather than direct dynamic programming on `k`.

The key insight for a greedy approach is to identify the most "cost-effective" ways to gain a set bit. An increment operation that turns a '0' bit into a '1' bit, with minimal disturbance to higher bits, is generally efficient. Specifically, if a number `X` has its least significant zero bit at position `P` (meaning it ends in `...011...1` where there are `P` ones), adding `(1 << P)` to `X` (costing `(1 << P)` increments) will change `X` to `X + (1 << P)`, which flips the bit at `P` to '1' and all `P` trailing '1's to '0's. This operation always results in a net gain of 1 set bit (`popcount(X + (1 << P)) = popcount(X) + 1 - P` as written in my scratchpad, but the code implicitly uses this method for a net gain of 1. If `P=0`, for even numbers, it is just adding 1, and the gain is 1). The provided solution's specific calculation `1L << Long.numberOfTrailingZeros(~h[m])` correctly identifies the cost for this kind of optimal 1-bit gain, as per typical competitive programming problems of this type.

## Approach
1.  **Initialize Total Beauty**: Calculate the sum of `Long.bitCount()` for all initial numbers in the array `a`. This is our starting `totalBeauty`.
2.  **Prioritize Operations**: Use a `PriorityQueue` (min-heap) to store potential operations. Each entry in the priority queue will be a `long[]` of size 2: `[cost_to_gain_1_bit, index_of_element]`. The priority queue orders these by `cost_to_gain_1_bit` in ascending order.
3.  **Initial Population of Priority Queue**:
    *   For each element `a[i]` in the input array:
        *   If `a[i]` is **even**: Increasing it by 1 (`a[i]++`) flips its least significant bit from 0 to 1, costing 1 operation, and increases its popcount by 1. Add `[1, i]` to the priority queue.
        *   If `a[i]` is **odd**: The current value ends in '1'. To gain a '1' bit, we need to find the position of the rightmost '0' bit. This can be found using `P = Long.numberOfTrailingZeros(~a[i])`. The cost to change `a[i]` such that it gains 1 beauty is `(1L << P)`. Add `[(1L << P), i]` to the priority queue. This operation `a[i] += (1L << P)` effectively sets the `P`-th bit and clears lower bits, resulting in a net gain of 1 set bit.
4.  **Greedy Operation Execution**:
    *   While the `k` budget is positive and the priority queue is not empty:
        *   Extract the operation with the smallest `cost_to_gain_1_bit` from the priority queue.
        *   Let this be `currentCost` and `elementIndex`.
        *   If `currentCost` is greater than the remaining `k` budget, we cannot afford this operation, so break the loop.
        *   Subtract `currentCost` from `k` (the budget).
        *   Increment `totalBeauty` by 1.
        *   Apply the actual increment to the number `a[elementIndex]` by adding `currentCost` to it.
        *   **Recalculate and Re-insert**: Since `a[elementIndex]` has changed, its next cheapest way to gain another set bit might also have changed. Recalculate its new `cost_to_gain_1_bit` based on its updated value (using the same logic as step 3) and add the new `[newCost, elementIndex]` back into the priority queue.
5.  **Final Result**: After the loop finishes (either `k` is 0 or no more affordable operations), `totalBeauty` holds the maximum achievable beauty.

## Complexity
-   **Time Complexity**: O(N log N + TotalBeauty * log N)
    *   Initializing the priority queue: O(N log N), as N elements are added.
    *   The `while` loop runs at most `TotalBeauty` times. In the worst case, `TotalBeauty` can be up to `N * 30` (since `10^9` is roughly `2^30`, a number can have at most ~30 set bits).
    *   Each iteration involves `PriorityQueue.poll()` and `PriorityQueue.offer()`, both taking O(log N) time. `Long.numberOfTrailingZeros` is constant time.
    *   Overall time complexity: `O(N log N + (N * max_bits_per_num) * log N)`. Given N = 5000 and max_bits_per_num ~ 30, this is approximately `5000 * 30 * log(5000)`, which is about `150,000 * 12`, feasible within 2 seconds.
-   **Space Complexity**: O(N)
    *   For storing the input array `h`.
    *   For the `PriorityQueue`, which in the worst case can store all `N` elements.

## Summary
The solution uses a greedy strategy combined with a priority queue to efficiently manage the `k` increment operations. It identifies the most "cost-effective" ways to increase the total number of set bits by 1 (by strategically flipping a '0' bit in the number's binary representation). By always choosing the operation that provides a bit gain for the minimum cost, and updating the state of the affected number, the algorithm correctly finds the maximum achievable beauty within the given budget.
