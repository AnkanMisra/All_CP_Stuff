# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is about tiling a rectangle `w × h` with `a × b` sheets, given two pre-placed sheets. The key conditions are that sheets cannot be rotated, cannot overlap, and can extend beyond the roof boundaries. This last condition simplifies the problem: it means we're looking for a periodic tiling of the entire infinite plane such that the `w × h` roof is covered, and the two pre-placed tiles fit into this periodic structure.

For a complete tiling without rotation, all placed sheets must have their bottom-left corners at `(x_sheet, y_sheet)` where `x_sheet` is a multiple of `a` and `y_sheet` is a multiple of `b`. That is, `x_sheet % a == 0` and `y_sheet % b == 0`.

If two sheets `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are already placed, they must both align with the same underlying grid. This means their `x` coordinates must have the same remainder when divided by `a`, and their `y` coordinates must have the same remainder when divided by `b`.
So, the conditions are:
`x1 % a == x2 % a` AND `y1 % b == y2 % b`.

However, the problem statement provides more complex definitions of `x1, y1, x2, y2`: they are relative coordinates where the sheet `[x, x+a]` and `[y, y+b]` covers part of `[0,w]` and `[0,h]`.
The crucial part is the constraint for `x1,x2,y1,y2`:
`-a+1 ≤ x1,x2 ≤ w-1` and `-b+1 ≤ y1,y2 ≤ h-1`. This implies the tiles are partially over the roof.

The provided solution uses a more subtle logic based on the relative positions of the pre-placed tiles.

## Approach
The solution analyzes the alignment of the two pre-placed tiles relative to each other, considering their "modulo" coordinates.

1.  **Calculate Modulo Coordinates**:
    *   `mx1 = x1 % a`
    *   `mx2 = x2 % a`
    *   `my1 = y1 % b`
    *   `my2 = y2 % b`
    *   The `mod` function ensures a positive remainder for negative numbers.

2.  **Determine Relative Position of Tiles**:
    *   `sameRow`: `true` if the vertical distance between `y1` and `y2` is less than `b`. This means the sheets might be in "the same row" of the tiling grid, potentially overlapping in height. `Math.abs(y1 - y2) < b`
    *   `sameCol`: `true` if the horizontal distance between `x1` and `x2` is less than `a`. This means the sheets might be in "the same column" of the tiling grid, potentially overlapping in width. `Math.abs(x1 - x2) < a`

3.  **Check Tiling Possibility**:
    *   If `sameRow` is true: This means the two tiles are either in the same "row" of the tiling pattern or adjacent rows that almost overlap vertically. For a valid tiling, their `x` modulo `a` values must be the same: `mx1 == mx2`.
    *   If `sameCol` is true: This means the two tiles are either in the same "column" of the tiling pattern or adjacent columns that almost overlap horizontally. For a valid tiling, their `y` modulo `b` values must be the same: `my1 == my2`.
    *   If neither `sameRow` nor `sameCol` is true: This means the two tiles are neither vertically nor horizontally "close" enough to imply a direct alignment on one axis. In this case, for a valid tiling, *at least one* of their modulo coordinates must match: `(mx1 == mx2) || (my1 == my2)`. This implies they might be aligned on the x-grid or the y-grid.

4.  **Output**: Print "Yes" if `ok` is true, otherwise "No".

The `mod` helper function ensures that negative `v % m` results are correctly handled to always give a positive remainder, consistent with grid alignment.

## Complexity
-   **Time Complexity**: O(1) per test case, as it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons.
-   **Space Complexity**: O(1) per test case.

## Summary
The solution determines if the roof can be tiled by checking the congruence of the coordinates of the two pre-placed tiles with respect to the tile dimensions. By analyzing whether the tiles are in close horizontal or vertical proximity, it applies specific congruence conditions (e.g., `x1 % a == x2 % a`) to validate if they align with a consistent tiling grid. This is a clever approach to a subtle geometry problem.
