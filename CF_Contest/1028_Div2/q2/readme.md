# B. Gellyfish and Baby's Breath

Flower gives Gellyfish two permutations* of [0, 1, ..., n−1]: p₀, p₁, ..., pₙ₋₁ and q₀, q₁, ..., qₙ₋₁.

Now Gellyfish wants to calculate an array r₀, r₁, ..., rₙ₋₁ through the following method:

For all i (0 ≤ i ≤ n−1),  
rᵢ = max_{0 ≤ j ≤ i} (2^{pⱼ} + 2^{q_{i−j}})

But since Gellyfish is very lazy, you have to help her figure out the elements of r.

Since the elements of r are very large, you are only required to output the elements of r modulo 998244353.

*An array b is a permutation of an array a if b consists of the elements of a in arbitrary order. For example, [4,2,3,4] is a permutation of [3,2,4,4] while [1,2,2] is not a permutation of [1,2,3].

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases.  
The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴).  
The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p₀, p₁, ..., pₙ₋₁ (0 ≤ pᵢ < n).

The third line of each test case contains n integers q₀, q₁, ..., qₙ₋₁ (0 ≤ qᵢ < n).

It is guaranteed that both p and q are permutations of [0, 1, ..., n−1].

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10⁵.

## Output

For each test case, output n integers r₀, r₁, ..., rₙ₋₁ in a single line, modulo 998244353.

## Note

In the first test case:
- r₀ = 2^{p₀} + 2^{q₀} = 1 + 2 = 3
- r₁ = max(2^{p₀} + 2^{q₁}, 2^{p₁} + 2^{q₀}) = max(1+4, 4+2) = 6
- r₂ = max(2^{p₀} + 2^{q₂}, 2^{p₁} + 2^{q₁}, 2^{p₂} + 2^{q₀}) = max(1+1, 4+4, 2+2) = 8
