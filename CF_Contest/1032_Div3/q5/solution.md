# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
We are given two integers **l** and **r** of the same length, and we need to find an integer **x** such that **l ≤ x ≤ r** and the sum **f(l, x) + f(x, r)** is minimized, where **f(a, b)** is the number of positions where the decimal digits of **a** and **b** match.

The key insight is that the more **x** differs from both **l** and **r**, the fewer matching digits there will be. However, since **x** must be between **l** and **r**, and both have the same number of digits, we can use dynamic programming to efficiently try all possible digit choices for **x** at each position, while keeping track of whether we are still "tight" to the lower or upper bound.

## Approach
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is used to build the answer digit by digit.
- At each digit position, we keep track of two flags:
  - Whether the current prefix of **x** is still equal to the prefix of **l** (**tight to l**).
  - Whether the current prefix of **x** is still equal to the prefix of **r** (**tight to r**).
- For each position, we try all possible digits for **x** that keep **x** within the bounds of **l** and **r**.
- For each possible digit, we update the DP state and count matches with **l** and **r** at this position.
- The answer is the minimum value of **f(l, x) + f(x, r)** over all possible DP states at the end.

**Why does this work?**  
By exploring all possible digits for **x** at each position, and keeping track of whether we are still at the lower or upper bound, we ensure that all valid **x** are considered. The DP ensures we do not recompute the same subproblems, making the solution efficient.

## Algorithm
1. **Initialize** a DP table `h` of size 2x2, where `h[k][l]` is the minimum sum for the current tightness to **l** and **r**.
2. Set `h[1][1] = 0` (both tight to **l** and **r** at the start).
3. For each digit position:
   - For each possible tightness state:
     - For each possible digit for **x** at this position (within the allowed range):
       - Update the match count if the digit matches **l** or **r** at this position.
       - Update the tightness flags for the next position.
       - Update the DP table for the next position.
4. After processing all digits, the answer is the minimum value in the DP table.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(length of l * 4 * 10) per test case (since for each digit, there are 4 tightness states and up to 10 possible digits).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (since the DP table is small and reused for each digit).

## Summary
**This solution uses digit DP to efficiently try all possible values of x between l and r, minimizing the sum of matching digits with both l and r.**  
By keeping track of tightness to the bounds and updating the DP table at each digit, we ensure all valid x are considered and the minimum is found.
