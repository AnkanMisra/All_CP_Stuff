# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is to check, for each box, whether all the given Fibonacci cubes can be placed inside the box according to the stacking rules. The cubes must be placed with their sides parallel to the box, cannot be rotated, and larger cubes cannot be placed on top of smaller ones. The optimal way is to always try to place the largest cube first, then recursively fit the remaining cubes into the leftover sub-boxes.

## Approach
- Precompute the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, as the maximum number of cubes is 10.
- For each test case, generate the list of cube sizes in decreasing order (largest to smallest).
- For each box, simulate the placement of cubes:
  - Start with the whole box as available space.
  - For each cube (from largest to smallest), try to fit it into any available sub-box.
  - If a cube fits, split the current sub-box into up to three smaller sub-boxes (representing the leftover space after placing the cube).
  - Continue this process for all cubes.
  - If all cubes are placed, mark the box as suitable; otherwise, mark it as unsuitable.
- Output a string for each test case, where each character represents whether the corresponding box can fit all cubes.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of boxes and n is the number of cubes (n â‰¤ 10).
- Space Complexity: O(n) per box for the list of sub-boxes.

## Summary
By always placing the largest cube first and recursively partitioning the box, we ensure that the placement is valid and efficient. The constraints allow this simulation approach, and the solution checks each box independently for the ability to fit all cubes.
