# Problem: Trip Shopping

## Problem Description
Ali and Bahamin decided to spend their summer vacation on the beautiful southern coasts of Iran. They also agreed to do some shopping during the trip — but instead of setting a fixed budget, they decided to **determine how much they would spend by playing a game**.

The game is played on **two arrays `a` and `b`, each containing `n` integers**.

The game will last for **`k` rounds**. In one round:
- First, **Ali selects two indices `i` and `j`** (`1 ≤ i < j ≤ n`);
- Then, **Bahamin rearranges the four integers `ai`, `aj`, `bi`, and `bj` arbitrarily**. Note that Bahamin can swap numbers between two arrays. He can also keep the two arrays unchanged.

After all the `k` rounds, the **value of the game is defined as `v = ∑(i=1 to n) |ai - bi|`**. Ali and Bahamin will spend exactly `v` coins during their trip.

However, their goals are quite different:
- **Ali wants to spend as little as possible**, that is, to **minimize `v`**;
- **Bahamin wants to spend as much as possible**, that is, to **maximize `v`**.

You have to find the **final amount of coins they will spend if both Ali and Bahamin play optimally**.

## Input Format
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`).

The first line of each test case contains two integers **`n` and `k`** (`2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`) — the length of `a` and `b`, and the number of rounds.

The second line contains **`n` integers `a1, a2, …, an`** (`1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9`) — the elements of `a`.

The third line contains **`n` integers `b1, b2, …, bn`** (`1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9`) — the elements of `b`.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5`.

## Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the **final amount of coins they will spend if both Ali and Bahamin play optimally**.

## Constraints
- **`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`** (number of test cases)
- **`2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`** (array length)
- **`1 ≤ k ≤ n`** (number of rounds)
- **`1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9`** (array elements)
- **Sum of `n` over all test cases ≤ 2⋅10^5`**

## Notes
In the first test case, Ali can only choose `(i, j) = (1, 2)`, and Bahamin can rearrange all four numbers. Thus, he can assign `a = [5, 1]` and `b = [3, 7]`. And the value of the game will be `v = |5-3| + |1-7| = 8`. It can be shown that this is the **maximum possible value reachable for Bahamin** — Other arrangements like `a = [5, 7], b = [1, 3]` are also possible, but they don't have larger values.

In the second test case, the **best strategy for Bahamin is to keep the two arrays unchanged**, regardless of what indices Ali selects. And the value of the game will be `v = |1-6| + |5-2| + |3-4| = 9`.
