# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that **Bahamin wants to maximize the sum of absolute differences** while **Ali wants to minimize it**. Since Bahamin gets the final say in rearranging the four selected numbers, he will always try to **maximize the contribution from the selected pairs**. The optimal strategy involves understanding that each position `i` contributes `|ai - bi|` to the final sum, and Bahamin can **rearrange values to create maximum separation** between paired elements.

## Approach
The solution uses a **segment-based approach** where each position is treated as a segment `[min(ai, bi), max(ai, bi)]`. The core idea is:

1. **Calculate the base contribution**: For each position `i`, the minimum possible contribution is `0` (when `ai = bi`) and maximum is `|ai - bi|`. Initially, assume all positions contribute their maximum.

2. **Model as intervals**: Convert each pair `(ai, bi)` into an interval `[min(ai, bi), max(ai, bi)]`. Sort these intervals by their left endpoints.

3. **Check for overlapping intervals**: If any two intervals overlap, Bahamin can **exchange values between overlapping segments** to potentially increase the total sum beyond the base value.

4. **Handle non-overlapping case**: If no intervals overlap, Bahamin can still **bridge the gap between the closest non-overlapping intervals** by moving values across the gap, adding `2 * minimum_gap` to the base sum.

5. **Final calculation**:
   - If intervals overlap: answer = base sum
   - If no overlap: answer = base sum + `2 * minimum_gap`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting the intervals
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the interval array

## Summary
This approach works because it **models the optimal rearrangement strategy** that Bahamin would use. When intervals overlap, Bahamin can already achieve maximum separation within the overlapping regions. When they don't overlap, he can **bridge gaps by moving extreme values** across non-overlapping segments, effectively doubling the gap contribution. The algorithm correctly handles the **game theory aspect** where Ali chooses pairs to minimize damage while Bahamin rearranges to maximize the sum.
