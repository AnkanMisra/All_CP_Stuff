# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
Given array `b`, we need to find any possible integer `x` such that there exists a beautiful array `a` (where each `a_i` divides `a_{i+1}`) and a subset of indices where multiplying by `x` produces `b`. The key is to realize that the ratio between consecutive elements in `b` must be preserved by the possible values of `a` and `x`.

## Approach
- For each test case:
  - For each consecutive pair `b_{i-1}` and `b_i`, compute the ratio `b_{i} / gcd(b_{i-1}, b_{i})`.
  - The least common multiple (LCM) of all such ratios over the array gives a possible value for `x`.
  - This works because, for a beautiful array, the ratio between consecutive elements must be an integer, and multiplying by `x` in a subset must not break the divisibility property.
- Output the computed `x` for each test case.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` per test case (since we process each element once)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` extra space per test case (excluding input storage)

## Summary
- The solution leverages the divisibility property of the beautiful array and the effect of multiplying by `x` on a subset.
- By taking the LCM of the ratios of consecutive elements, we ensure the divisibility property is preserved and find a valid `x`.
- This approach is efficient and guarantees a correct answer due to the problem's constraints.
