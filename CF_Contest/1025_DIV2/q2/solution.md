# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

The problem is a two-player game on an `n × m` grid. Each turn, Mouf cuts the grid along a row or column, always keeping the part with Fouad's monster. Fouad can then move the monster anywhere in the remaining grid. Both play optimally: Mouf wants to minimize, Fouad wants to maximize the number of turns until only one cell remains.

The optimal strategy for Fouad is to always move the monster to the cell that is farthest from any edge, maximizing the minimum distance to the grid's borders. The number of turns is determined by how many times the grid can be halved (by rows or columns) until only one cell remains.

### Approach

- If the grid is already 1×1, the answer is 0.
- For any other grid:
  - Compute the minimum distance from the monster's current row to the top or bottom edge: `n1 = min(a, n - a + 1)`
  - Compute the minimum distance from the monster's current column to the left or right edge: `m1 = min(b, m - b + 1)`
  - The number of cuts possible along rows is `F1n = floor(log2(n))`
  - The number of cuts possible along columns is `F1m = floor(log2(m))`
  - The number of cuts possible along the smaller subgrid is `F1n1 = floor(log2(n1))`, `F1m1 = floor(log2(m1))`
  - The answer is `min(F1n1 + F1m, F1n + F1m1) + 1`

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int testcases = sc.nextInt();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (testcases!=0) {
            long n = sc.nextLong();
            long m = sc.nextLong();
            long a = sc.nextLong();
            long b = sc.nextLong();
            if (n == 1 && m == 1) {
                sb.append(0).append('\n');
            } else {
                long n1 = a < n - a + 1 ? a : n - a + 1;
                long m1 = b < m - b + 1 ? b : m - b + 1;
                long F1n = 64 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n - 1);
                long F1m = 64 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(m - 1);
                long F1n1 = 64 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n1 - 1);
                long F1m1 = 64 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(m1 - 1);
                long horiz = F1n1 + F1m;
                long vert = F1n + F1m1;
                sb.append(Math.min(horiz, vert) + 1).append('\n');
            }
        testcases--;
        }
        System.out.print(sb);
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) per test case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space.

### Summary

- The solution uses bit manipulation to efficiently compute the number of possible cuts.
- The answer is the minimum number of turns required to reduce the grid to a single cell, considering both row and column cuts.
- This approach is efficient and works for very large grids.
