# Solution Explanation

## Intuition

You can flip the sign of any element any number of times, including the first element.  
Since all absolute values are unique, after any sequence of sign flips, the array will contain the same set of absolute values, just with different signs.

The median is determined by the order of the elements.  
To make `a_1` (or `-a_1`) the median, you want its absolute value to be in the correct position after sorting by value (with any sign).

## Approach

- Let `x = |a_1|`.
- For each other element, count how many have absolute value **greater** than `x`.
- To make `a_1` the median, there must be at least as many elements with greater absolute value as required for the median position.

  - For an array of size `n`, the median is the element at position `(n+1)/2` (1-based, after sorting).
  - So, there must be at least `(n-1)/2` elements with absolute value greater than `x` (since the median is the `(n-1)/2`-th smallest among the rest).

- If this is possible, print "YES", otherwise "NO".

## Algorithm

1. For each test case:
    - Read `n` and `a_1`.
    - Set `x = |a_1|`.
    - For the rest of the array, count how many elements have `|a_i| > x`.
    - If `countGreater >= (n-1)/2`, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int testcases = sc.nextInt();
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (testcases!=0) {
      int n = sc.nextInt();
      int a1 = sc.nextInt();
      int x = Math.abs(a1);
      int countGreater = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int ai = sc.nextInt();
        if (Math.abs(ai) > x) {
          countGreater++;
        }
      }
      int requiredGreater = (n - 1) / 2;
      if (countGreater >= requiredGreater) {
        sb.append("YES");
      } else {
        sb.append("NO");
      }
      sb.append('\n');
      testcases--;
    }
    String ans=sb.toString();
    System.out.print(ans);
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(\sum n)\), where the sum is over all test cases and does not exceed \(10^5\).
- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\) extra space (excluding input and output).

## Summary

- The solution leverages the uniqueness of absolute values and the ability to flip signs.
- It checks if the absolute value of the first element can be positioned as the median by counting how many elements have greater absolute value.
- Efficient and optimal for the given constraints.
