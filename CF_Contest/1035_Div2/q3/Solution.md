# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the lexicographically smallest array of length `n` with elements in `[l, r]` such that the bitwise AND and XOR of all elements are equal. Since the array can be extremely large, we only need to output the `k`-th element or `-1` if no such array exists. The key insight is to minimize the first elements as much as possible, and to exploit properties of AND and XOR for repeated or power-of-two values.

## Approach
- If `n = 1`, the only possible array is `[l]` (if `l == r`), and the answer is `l`.
- If `n = 2`, it is only possible if there exists a value in `[l, r]` such that both elements are equal, but for most cases, no such array exists.
- For `n > 2`, the lexicographically smallest array is constructed by filling as many elements as possible with the smallest value `l`, and then adjusting the last elements to satisfy the AND and XOR condition. If this is not possible within the range, output `-1`.
- For large `n`, the only way to satisfy the condition is if all elements are equal and that value is a power of two, or if the range allows for such a construction.
- The answer for the `k`-th element is determined by the construction above.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(1)` per test case (no iteration over `n` is needed, only mathematical checks)
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

## Summary
- The solution leverages the properties of bitwise AND and XOR, especially for arrays of equal elements and powers of two.
- For most cases, the answer is either the smallest value in the range or `-1` if the construction is not possible.
- The approach avoids iterating over large arrays and only computes the answer for the `k`-th element directly, making it efficient for very large `n`.
