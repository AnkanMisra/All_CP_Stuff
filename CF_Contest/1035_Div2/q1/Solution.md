# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem allows two operations to transform `a` into `b`: increment by 1 (cost `x`) and XOR with 1 (cost `y`). The goal is to reach `a = b` with minimum cost, or determine if it's impossible. The key insight is to consider the parity (even/odd) of `a` and `b`, and to use the cheaper operation optimally, possibly alternating between them.

## Approach
- If `a = b`, the cost is `0` (no operations needed).
- If `b < a`, it is only possible to reach `b` from `a` if `a` is odd and `b = a - 1` (since XOR with 1 flips the last bit, only allowing a decrease by 1 for odd `a`). In this case, the cost is `y`. Otherwise, it is impossible (`-1`).
- If `b > a`, calculate the difference `f = b - a`:
  - The two operations can be combined: `a + 1` (cost `x`) and `a âŠ• 1` (cost `y`). For even `a`, alternating these two operations can increase `a` by 2 at a time, using both operations. For odd `a`, a single `a + 1` brings it to even, then proceed as above.
  - The minimum cost for a pair of steps (increase by 2) is `min(x, y) + x`.
  - For even `a`, use as many pairs as possible, then possibly one more operation if the difference is odd.
  - For odd `a`, do one `a + 1` (cost `x`), then proceed as for even `a`.
- Always choose the cheaper operation for the single step if needed.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(1)` per test case (constant time arithmetic and logic)
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

## Summary
- The solution leverages the parity of `a` and `b` to determine the optimal sequence of operations.
- It is impossible to decrease `a` to `b` unless `a` is odd and `b = a - 1`.
- For increasing `a`, the solution alternates between the two operations to minimize cost, always using the cheaper operation when possible.
- The approach is efficient and handles all edge cases, including when no solution exists.
