# Solution Explanation

## Intuition

This is a variant of the Nim game with a special "instant win" rule:  
- If the XOR of the array is 0 before a player's turn, that player wins immediately.
- Otherwise, the player must remove one stack.

The winner depends on the initial XOR and the parity (odd/even) of the number of stacks.

## Approach

1. Compute the XOR of all elements in the array.
2. If the XOR is 0 at the start, Player 1 wins immediately (`return false`).
3. If the XOR is not 0:
   - If the number of stacks is **odd**, Player 2 wins (`return true`).
   - If the number of stacks is **even**, Player 1 wins (`return false`).

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean makeZero(int arr[]) {
        int b = arr.length;
        int c = 0;
        for (int d : arr) {
            c ^= d;
        }
        if (c != 0 && (b % 2 == 1)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1).

## Summary

- If the initial XOR is 0, Player 1 wins.
- If the initial XOR is not 0 and the number of stacks is odd, Player 2 wins.
- Otherwise, Player 1 wins.
