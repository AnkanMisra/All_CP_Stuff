# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the **maximum path sum between two special nodes** in a binary tree. A special node is one that has **exactly one connection** (either a leaf node or a node with only one child). The key insight is to use a **modified tree traversal** that calculates the maximum path sum ending at each node while tracking the global maximum path sum that passes through internal nodes.

## Approach
The solution uses a **recursive depth-first search (DFS)** approach with the following strategy:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If the node is `null`, return `0`
   - If the node is a **leaf node** (special node), return its value

2. **Recursive Cases:**
   - Calculate the maximum path sum from left and right subtrees
   - If the node has **only one child** (special node), return the sum of current node and the child's path
   - If the node has **both children**, it can potentially be part of a path connecting two special nodes

3. **Global Maximum Tracking:**
   - For nodes with both children, update the global maximum with `current_node + left_path + right_path`
   - Return the maximum of either left or right path plus current node value for further recursion

4. **Final Result:**
   - Handle the edge case where the root itself might be a special node
   - Return the maximum between the global maximum and the path ending at root

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack

## Summary
This approach works by **combining the classic maximum path sum algorithm** with the constraint that paths must connect special nodes. The algorithm efficiently identifies special nodes during traversal and maintains both local path sums and a global maximum. **Key corner cases** include trees where the root is a special node and trees with only two nodes.
