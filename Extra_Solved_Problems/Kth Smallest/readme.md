**Follow up:** Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.

## Input Format

- An integer array `arr[]`.
- An integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), where n is the size of the array.

## Output Format

- An integer representing the kth smallest element in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3

**Output:**  
7
