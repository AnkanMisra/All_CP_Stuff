# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The **straightforward approach** is to merge both sorted arrays into a single list, sort the combined list, and then find the median. Since we need the median of the combined array, we can **combine all elements** from both arrays and then **locate the middle element(s)** based on whether the total length is odd or even.

## Approach
1. **Create an ArrayList** to store all elements from both arrays
2. **Add all elements** from the first array `a[]` to the list
3. **Add all elements** from the second array `b[]` to the list
4. **Sort the combined list** using `Collections.sort()`
5. **Calculate the median** based on the total size:
   - If the **total size is odd**: return the middle element at index `size/2`
   - If the **total size is even**: return the **average of the two middle elements** at indices `size/2-1` and `size/2`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O((m + n) log(m + n))` where `m` and `n` are the sizes of the two arrays. The bottleneck is the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m + n)` for storing all elements in the ArrayList.

## Summary
This approach works by **combining both arrays** and finding the median through sorting. While it's **simple to implement and understand**, it doesn't take advantage of the fact that both input arrays are already sorted. The key insight is that for **median calculation**, we need the middle element(s) of the combined sorted array. **Corner cases** include handling empty arrays and ensuring proper calculation for both odd and even total lengths. A more optimal solution would use **binary search** to achieve `O(log(min(m, n)))` time complexity by leveraging the sorted nature of input arrays.
