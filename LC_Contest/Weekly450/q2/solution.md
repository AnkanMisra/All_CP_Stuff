# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

We need to sort the array based on the sum of digits of each number (and by value if digit sums are equal), and count the minimum number of swaps required to achieve this order. This is a classic "minimum swaps to sort an array" problem, where we first determine the target sorted order, then count the cycles in the permutation.

### Approach

- For each number, compute its digit sum and store a tuple: `[digit_sum, value, original_index]`.
- Sort the tuples by digit sum, and by value if digit sums are equal.
- The problem reduces to finding the minimum number of swaps to transform the original array into the sorted array.
- Use a visited array to track which elements have been placed correctly.
- For each unvisited element, follow the cycle of indices until returning to the start, and add `cycle_length - 1` to the swap count.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(int[] a) {
        int b = a.length;
        int[][] c = new int[b][3];
        for (int d=0;d<b;d++) {
            c[d][0] = sum(a[d]);
            c[d][1] = a[d];
            c[d][2] = d;
        }
        Arrays.sort(c,(x, y)->{
            if (x[0] != y[0]) {
                return x[0] - y[0];
            }
            else{
                return x[1] - y[1];    
            }
        });
        boolean[] e = new boolean[b];
        int f=0;
        for (int d=0;d<b;d++) {
            if (e[d]||c[d][2]==d){
                continue;  
            } 
            int g=d;
            int h=0;
            while (!e[g]){
                e[g]=true;
                g=c[g][2];
                h++;
            }
            f+=h-1;
        }
        return f;
    }
    public static int sum(int a) {
        int b=0;
        while(a!=0) {
            b+=a%10;
            a/=10;
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the array (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the tuples and visited array.

### Summary

- The solution computes the target sorted order using digit sums and values.
- It then counts the minimum number of swaps needed to reach this order using cycle decomposition.
- This approach is efficient and optimal for the given constraints.
