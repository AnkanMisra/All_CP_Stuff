# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The unlocking rule requires that every computer (except computer 0) can only be unlocked by a previously unlocked computer with a lower complexity and a lower index. This means that for any valid permutation, every computer must have at least one previously unlocked computer with a lower complexity and a lower index. The only way this is possible is if the complexities are strictly increasing from computer 0 onwards.

## Approach
- First, check if all complexities after the first one are strictly greater than the complexity of computer 0. If not, it is impossible to unlock all computers, so return 0.
- If the condition is satisfied, any order of unlocking the remaining computers is valid, as each will always have computer 0 (with the lowest complexity and index) available as an unlocker.
- The number of valid permutations is simply the number of ways to arrange the remaining `n-1` computers, which is `(n-1)!`.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, for checking the condition and computing the factorial.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as only a few variables are used.

## Summary
The solution checks if all computers can be unlocked by ensuring all complexities after the first are strictly greater than the first. If so, the answer is `(n-1)!` modulo 10^9+7; otherwise, it is 0.
