# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is to determine if you can make all elements of an array (containing only 1 and -1) equal using at most `k` operations, where each operation flips two adjacent elements. This is similar to a "parity flip" or "prefix flip" problem, and can be solved greedily by processing the array from left to right.

## Approach
- Convert the array to a binary form: treat `1` as `0` and `-1` as `1` (or vice versa).
- Try to make all elements `0` (all 1s) and all elements `1` (all -1s), and check if either is possible within `k` operations.
- For each target (`0` or `1`), iterate from left to right:
  - If the current element does not match the target, flip it and the next element (using XOR).
  - Count the number of flips.
- After processing, if the last element matches the target and the number of flips is within `k`, return `true`.
- If neither target is possible within `k` operations, return `false`.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, since each element is processed at most twice.
- Space Complexity: O(n), for the temporary arrays used in the process.

## Summary
By simulating the process for both possible target values (all 1s or all -1s), and greedily flipping pairs as needed, we can efficiently determine if the transformation is possible within the allowed number of operations.
