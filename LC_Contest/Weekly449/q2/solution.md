# Solution Explanation

## Intuition

The problem asks if we can make a single horizontal or vertical cut in a grid so that the sum of the numbers on both sides of the cut is equal.  
The key insight is that for such a partition to exist, the total sum of the grid must be even, and there must exist a row or column prefix whose sum is exactly half of the total sum.

---

## Approach

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:**  
   Compute the sum of all elements in the grid.

2. **Check for Evenness:**  
   If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to split the grid into two equal-sum parts.

3. **Try Horizontal Cuts:**  
   For each possible horizontal cut (between row `i` and `i+1`), compute the sum of the top section.  
   If at any point this sum equals half the total sum, return `true`.

4. **Try Vertical Cuts:**  
   For each possible vertical cut (between column `j` and `j+1`), compute the sum of the left section.  
   If at any point this sum equals half the total sum, return `true`.

5. **Return False if No Cut Works:**  
   If neither a horizontal nor a vertical cut yields two equal-sum sections, return `false`.

## Algorithm

1. Compute the total sum of the grid.
2. If the total sum is odd, return `false`.
3. For each possible horizontal cut, accumulate the sum of rows above the cut and check if it equals half the total sum.
4. For each possible vertical cut, accumulate the sum of columns to the left of the cut and check if it equals half the total sum.
5. If no such cut is found, return `false`.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
  public boolean canPartitionGrid(int[][] grid) {
    int m = grid.length;
    int n = grid[0].length;
    long totalsum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        totalsum += grid[i][j];
      }
    }
    if ((totalsum & 1) == 1) {
      return false;
    }
    long half = totalsum / 2;
    long sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        sum += grid[i][j];
      }
      if (sum == half) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    sum = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
      for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        sum += grid[i][j];
      }
      if (sum == half) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.  
  - Calculating the total sum takes \(O(mn)\).
  - Each cut check (horizontal and vertical) also takes up to \(O(mn)\) in the worst case, but the total work is still within \(O(mn)\) due to the constraints.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\), as only a few variables are used for accumulation.

---

## Edge Cases

- If the grid has only one row or one column, only one type of cut is possible.
- If all elements are the same, a cut may be possible if the total sum is even and the grid can be split into two equal-sized parts.
- If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to partition the grid as required.

---

## Summary

This approach efficiently checks for a possible equal-sum partition by leveraging prefix sums for both rows and columns, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal for the given constraints.
