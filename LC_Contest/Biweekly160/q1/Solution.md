# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem requires converting `n * n` to hexadecimal (base-16) and `n * n * n` to hexatrigesimal (base-36), then concatenating the two results. The key insight is to use standard base conversion techniques and string manipulation.

## Approach
- Compute `n * n` and `n * n * n`.
- Convert `n * n` to its **hexadecimal** representation using digits `0-9` and uppercase `A-F`.
- Convert `n * n * n` to its **hexatrigesimal** representation using digits `0-9` and uppercase `A-Z`.
- Concatenate the two resulting strings and return the result.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(log n)` for each conversion (since the number of digits is proportional to the logarithm of the value).
- Space Complexity: `O(1)` (ignoring output string size).

## Summary
This approach works efficiently because both base conversions are straightforward and the constraints are small. The use of uppercase letters for digits above `9` ensures the output matches the required format. There are no tricky edge cases since `n` is always at least `1`.
