# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is about finding the **minimum time to reach the destination node** in a directed graph where each edge is only available during a specific time window. Since you can wait at any node, the challenge is to efficiently decide when to move and when to wait, while always taking the earliest possible route to the destination.

## Approach
- **Model the graph** using adjacency lists, where each edge stores the destination node and its available time window (`start`, `end`).
- Use a **Dijkstra-like algorithm** (priority queue based BFS) to always process the node with the earliest arrival time next.
- For each node, keep track of the **earliest time you can reach it** (`dist[]`).
- At each step:
  - For every outgoing edge from the current node, check if the current time is within the edge's time window. If not, you may need to wait until the edge becomes available (if possible).
  - If you can use the edge, calculate the **arrival time** at the next node (`max(current time, start) + 1`).
  - If this arrival time is better (smaller) than the previously recorded time for that node, update it and add it to the priority queue.
- If you reach the destination node, return the time. If the queue is empty and you haven't reached the destination, return `-1`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m log n)`, where `m` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes (due to the priority queue operations and edge relaxations).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n + m)`, for the adjacency list and distance array.

## Summary
- The approach works because **waiting is always allowed**, so you never miss an edge as long as you can reach its start time.
- The priority queue ensures you always process the earliest possible arrival at each node, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.
- **Key insight:** Always take the earliest available edge, but wait if necessary, and never revisit a node at a later time than previously found.
- **Corner cases:** If there are no outgoing edges from the start node, or if all edges' time windows are missed, the answer is `-1`.
