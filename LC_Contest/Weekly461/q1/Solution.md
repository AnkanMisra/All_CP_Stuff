# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To check if an array is **trionic**, we need to find indices `p` and `q` such that the array has three distinct segments: **strictly increasing**, **strictly decreasing**, and **strictly increasing** again. The key insight is to precompute information about which positions can serve as valid endpoints for each segment type.

## Approach
The solution uses **three preprocessing arrays** to efficiently check all possible combinations of `p` and `q`:

1. **Prefix increasing array (`inc`)**: For each position `i`, `inc[i]` indicates whether `nums[0...i]` is strictly increasing
2. **Suffix increasing array (`sufinc`)**: For each position `i`, `sufinc[i]` indicates whether `nums[i...n-1]` is strictly increasing
3. **Decreasing endpoint array (`decend`)**: For each position `i`, `decend[i]` stores the **rightmost position** reachable from `i` while maintaining a strictly decreasing sequence

Then, for each potential `p` (where `nums[0...p]` is strictly increasing), we check all possible `q` values in the decreasing range and verify if `nums[q...n-1]` is strictly increasing.

## Algorithm
1. **Build prefix increasing array**: Check if each prefix `nums[0...i]` is strictly increasing
2. **Build suffix increasing array**: Check if each suffix `nums[i...n-1]` is strictly increasing
3. **Build decreasing endpoint array**: For each position, find the rightmost reachable position in a decreasing sequence
4. **Check all valid combinations**: For each valid `p`, iterate through possible `q` values and check if the suffix from `q` is strictly increasing

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(nÂ²)` - We iterate through all possible `p` values and for each `p`, we check multiple `q` values
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - We use three additional arrays of size `n`

## Summary
This approach works by **precomputing segment properties** to avoid redundant calculations. The key insight is that we can determine valid trionic configurations by checking if we can form the required three segments with the right monotonicity properties. **Corner cases** include arrays that are too short or don't have sufficient variation to form all three required segments.
