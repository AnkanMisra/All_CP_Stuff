# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to use **binary search** on the time `t` to find the minimum time when the string becomes active. For any given time `t`, we can efficiently calculate the number of valid substrings by counting **invalid substrings** (those without any `'*'`) and subtracting from the total.

## Approach
The solution uses **binary search** combined with an efficient substring counting technique:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: Search for the minimum time `t` in range `[0, n-1]` where the string becomes active

2. **Substring Counting Strategy**: Instead of directly counting valid substrings, count **invalid substrings** (continuous segments without `'*'`) and subtract from total substrings

3. **Invalid Substring Calculation**: For each continuous segment of non-star characters of length `len`, the number of substrings is `len * (len + 1) / 2`

4. **Validation Function**: For a given time `t`:
   - Mark positions `order[0]` to `order[t]` as `'*'`
   - Find all continuous segments of non-star characters
   - Calculate total invalid substrings
   - Valid substrings = Total substrings - Invalid substrings
   - Check if valid substrings ≥ `k`

## Algorithm
1. Calculate total possible substrings: `n * (n + 1) / 2`
2. Binary search on time `t` from `0` to `n-1`
3. For each `mid` time:
   - Create boolean array marking star positions up to time `mid`
   - Iterate through string to find continuous non-star segments
   - Sum up invalid substrings from all segments
   - Calculate valid substrings = total - invalid
   - If valid ≥ `k`, try smaller time; otherwise try larger time
4. Return the minimum valid time, or `-1` if impossible

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` - Binary search `O(log n)` with `O(n)` validation per iteration
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - Boolean array to track star positions

## Summary
This approach efficiently solves the problem by **avoiding direct enumeration** of all substrings. The key insight is that counting invalid substrings (continuous non-star segments) is much simpler than counting valid ones. The binary search ensures we find the **minimum time** efficiently, making this solution optimal for the given constraints.
