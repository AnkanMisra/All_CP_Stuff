# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the maximum score of any subarray, where the score is defined as the product of the subarray's length and the GCD of its elements, after at most `k` elements in the array are doubled (each at most once). Doubling an element can increase the GCD of a subarray if it helps align more elements to a higher power of 2.

## Approach
- For each subarray, compute its GCD and track the number of elements in the subarray that have the minimum power of 2 in their factorization.
- If the number of such elements is less than or equal to `k`, you can double all of them, effectively increasing the GCD of the subarray by a factor of 2.
- For each subarray, calculate the score as `length * GCD * (2 if you can double all min-2-power elements, else 1)`.
- Keep track of the maximum score found.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n^2 * log(maxA)), where n is the length of the array and maxA is the maximum value in the array. This is because for each subarray, you compute the GCD (which is O(log(maxA))) and scan the subarray.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the power-of-2 counts.

## Summary
By analyzing the power of 2 in each element and using at most `k` doublings to maximize the GCD for each subarray, the solution efficiently finds the maximum possible score. The approach leverages the fact that doubling elements with the minimum power of 2 can increase the GCD for the entire subarray.
