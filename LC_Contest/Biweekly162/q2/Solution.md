# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To minimize removals, we need to **find the longest subarray** that can be balanced. Since we want `max <= min * k`, we can sort the array and use a **sliding window approach** to find the longest valid subarray where the condition holds.

## Approach
1. **Sort the array** to make it easier to work with min and max values in any subarray
2. Use **two pointers** (`i` for left boundary, `r` for right boundary) to maintain a sliding window
3. For each left boundary `i`, extend the right boundary `r` as far as possible while maintaining the balance condition: `nums[r] <= nums[i] * k`
4. Track the **maximum window size** found during this process
5. The answer is **total elements minus maximum valid subarray length**

## Algorithm
1. Sort the input array `nums`
2. Initialize `maxWindow = 1` (minimum valid subarray size) and `right = 0`
3. For each position `i` from 0 to n-1:
   - While `right + 1 < n` and `nums[right + 1] <= nums[i] * k`, increment `right`
   - Update `maxWindow = max(maxWindow, right - i + 1)`
4. Return `n - maxWindow`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting, where n is the length of the array
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` excluding the space used by sorting

## Summary
The approach works by **finding the longest balanced subarray** after sorting. Since we sort the array, for any subarray from index `i` to `r`, the minimum is `nums[i]` and maximum is `nums[r]`. The two-pointer technique efficiently finds the longest valid window for each starting position. The key insight is that we want to **keep the maximum number of elements** rather than remove the minimum number.
