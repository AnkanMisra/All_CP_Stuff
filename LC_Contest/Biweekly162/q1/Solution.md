# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
Since the tourist must take **exactly one ride from each category** and can take them in **any order**, we need to consider all possible combinations. For each land ride and water ride pair, there are **two possible orderings**: land first then water, or water first then land. We calculate the finish time for both orderings and take the minimum across all combinations.

## Approach
The solution uses a **brute force approach** to examine all possible ride combinations and orderings:

1. **Iterate through all land rides** and **all water rides** to form pairs
2. For each pair, calculate finish times for **both possible orderings**:
   - **Land ride first**: Start land ride at its opening time, finish it, then start water ride at `max(land_finish_time, water_start_time)`
   - **Water ride first**: Start water ride at its opening time, finish it, then start land ride at `max(water_finish_time, land_start_time)`
3. **Track the minimum finish time** across all combinations and orderings
4. Return the **overall minimum finish time**

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `ans` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
2. For each land ride `i`:
   - Calculate `finishLand = landStartTime[i] + landDuration[i]`
   - For each water ride `j`:
     - **Scenario 1 (Land → Water)**: `f1 = max(finishLand, waterStartTime[j]) + waterDuration[j]`
     - **Scenario 2 (Water → Land)**: `f2 = max(waterStartTime[j] + waterDuration[j], landStartTime[i]) + landDuration[i]`
     - Update `ans = min(ans, f1, f2)`
3. Return `ans`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n × m)` where `n` is the number of land rides and `m` is the number of water rides
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space

## Summary
This approach works because it **exhaustively checks all valid combinations** of rides and orderings. The key insight is that for any pair of rides, there are only **two possible orderings**, and we can calculate the finish time for each ordering using the constraint that the second ride must start at or after both its opening time and the finish time of the first ride. The solution handles all **corner cases** naturally, including scenarios where rides have different opening times and durations.
