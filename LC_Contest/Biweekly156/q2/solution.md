# Solution Explanation

## Intuition

The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to turn all elements of an array into zero, where in each operation you can select a subarray and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to zero.

A key observation is that each unique "layer" of positive numbers (when visualized as a histogram) must be removed one by one, but overlapping or nested layers can be removed together if they are contiguous. The solution uses a **monotonic stack** to efficiently count the number of such "layers" that need to be removed.

---

## Approach

- Use a stack (`b`) to keep track of the current "layers" of numbers as we iterate through the array.
- For each element, if it is less than the top of the stack, we pop from the stack and count an operation (since a new "layer" ends here).
- If the current element is greater than the top of the stack, we push it onto the stack (starting a new "layer").
- We append a zero at the end to ensure all layers are closed and counted.
- The answer is the total number of times we pop a layer that is strictly greater than the previous one.

---

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a stack `b` with a single zero.
2. Initialize a counter `d` to zero.
3. Iterate through the array, and for each element (plus an extra zero at the end):
    - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is greater than the current element:
        - Pop the stack and increment the counter if the new top is less than the popped value.
    - If the current element is greater than the top of the stack, push it onto the stack.
4. Return the counter.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
        int[] b = new int[n + 2];
        int c = 1;
        b[0] = 0;
        int d = 0;
        for (int e = 0; e <= n; e++) {
            int f = e < n ? a[e] : 0;
            while (c > 1 && b[c - 1] > f) {
                int g = b[--c];
                if (b[c - 1] < g){
                  d++;  
                } 
            }
            if (b[c - 1] < f) {
                b[c++] = f;
            }
        }
        return d;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(n)\), for the stack used to keep track of the layers.

---

## Edge Cases

- If the array is already all zeros, the answer is 0.
- If all elements are the same positive number, only 1 operation is needed.
- The algorithm handles repeated and nested values efficiently.

---

## Summary

This approach leverages a monotonic stack to efficiently count the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the array to all zeros, by tracking the "layers" of numbers and counting when a new layer is removed.
