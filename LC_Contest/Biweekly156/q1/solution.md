# Solution Explanation

## Intuition

The problem asks us to find the most frequent vowel and the most frequent consonant in a given string, and return the sum of their frequencies.  
To solve this efficiently, we can count the frequency of each character in a single pass through the string.  
As we count, we keep track of the highest frequency seen so far for any vowel and any consonant.

## Approach

1. **Frequency Counting:**  
   Use an array of size 26 to count the frequency of each lowercase English letter.

2. **Tracking Maximums:**  
   As we process each character, check if it is a vowel or a consonant.  
   - If it's a vowel, update the maximum vowel frequency if needed.
   - If it's a consonant, update the maximum consonant frequency if needed.

3. **Result:**  
   After processing the string, return the sum of the maximum vowel and consonant frequencies.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize an integer array `a` of size 26 to store the frequency of each letter.
2. Initialize two variables, `b` (for vowels) and `c` (for consonants), to 0.
3. For each character `d` in the string:
    - Convert `d` to its corresponding index `e` (`d - 'a'`).
    - Increment the frequency count for that character.
    - If `d` is a vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`):
        - Update `b` to be the maximum of its current value and the frequency of `d`.
    - Otherwise (it's a consonant):
        - Update `c` to be the maximum of its current value and the frequency of `d`.
4. Return the sum `b + c`.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFreqSum(String s) {
        int[] a = new int[26];
        int b = 0, c = 0;
        for (char d : s.toCharArray()) {
            int e = d - 'a';
            a[e]++;
            if (d == 'a'||d == 'e'||d == 'i'||d== 'o'|| d == 'u') {
                b = Math.max(b, a[e]);
            } else {
                c = Math.max(c, a[e]);
            }
        }
        return b + c;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.  
  We process each character exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\), since the frequency array size is constant (26 letters).

---

## Edge Cases

- If the string contains only vowels, the maximum consonant frequency will be 0.
- If the string contains only consonants, the maximum vowel frequency will be 0.
- If multiple vowels or consonants have the same maximum frequency, any one can be chosen (as per the problem statement).

---

## Summary

This approach efficiently finds the most frequent vowel and consonant in a single pass, using simple array-based counting and conditional logic.
