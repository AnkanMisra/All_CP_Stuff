# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
- The problem asks us to find **islands** (groups of 4-directionally connected positive cells) in a grid and count how many have a **total value divisible by `k`**.
- The key insight is to use a **graph traversal** (such as BFS or DFS) to explore each island, sum its values, and check divisibility.

## Approach
- Iterate through each cell in the grid.
- If a cell contains a **positive integer** and has not been visited, start a **BFS** (or DFS) from that cell to explore the entire island.
- During traversal, mark each visited cell and accumulate the **sum of values** for the current island.
- After finishing the traversal for an island, check if the **total sum is divisible by `k`**. If so, increment the answer.
- Continue until all cells have been processed.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` — Each cell is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` — For the visited array and the BFS/DFS queue.

## Summary
- This approach works because **each island is explored exactly once**, and the sum is computed efficiently during traversal.
- The use of a **visited array** ensures no cell is counted more than once.
- Handles all edge cases, including islands of size 1 and grids with no land.
