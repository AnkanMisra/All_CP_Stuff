# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To make **at least ⌈n / 2⌉ troops lucky**, we need to find the **minimum cost** to convert non-lucky troops into lucky ones. The key insight is that for each non-lucky troop, we can calculate the **minimum soldiers needed** to make it divisible by `k`, then select the **cheapest conversions** until we have enough lucky troops.

## Approach
1. **Calculate required lucky troops**: We need `⌈n / 2⌉ = (n + 1) / 2` lucky troops
2. **Count existing lucky troops**: Count troops where `soldiers % k == 0`
3. **Calculate conversion costs**: For each non-lucky troop with `soldiers`, the cost to make it lucky is `(k - soldiers % k) % k`
4. **Sort costs and select minimum**: Sort all conversion costs and pick the **smallest ones** until we have enough lucky troops
5. **Return total cost**: Sum up the selected conversion costs

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `required = (n + 1) / 2` and `luckyCount = 0`
2. Create a list `costs` to store conversion costs
3. For each troop:
   - If `soldiers % k == 0`, increment `luckyCount`
   - Otherwise, add `(k - soldiers % k) % k` to `costs`
4. If `luckyCount >= required`, return `0`
5. Sort the `costs` array in ascending order
6. Calculate `needed = required - luckyCount`
7. Sum the first `needed` elements from sorted `costs`
8. Return the total sum

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting the costs array
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the costs of non-lucky troops

## Summary
This **greedy approach** works because we always choose the **cheapest conversions first**. The formula `(k - soldiers % k) % k` correctly calculates the minimum soldiers needed to make any troop lucky. The modulo operation handles the edge case where a troop is already lucky (cost = 0). **Corner cases** include when we already have enough lucky troops (return 0) and when all troops need conversion.
