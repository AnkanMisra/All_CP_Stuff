# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
This problem asks us to find the **maximum length of consecutive 1's** after flipping at most `k` zeros. The key insight is to use a **sliding window approach** where we maintain a window that contains at most `k` zeros. By expanding and contracting this window, we can find the optimal subarray.

## Approach
We use the **two-pointer sliding window technique**:

1. **Initialize pointers**: Start with `left = 0`, `right = 0`, and `zeroCount = 0` to track zeros in current window
2. **Expand window**: Move the `right` pointer and include elements in the window
3. **Count zeros**: When we encounter a zero, increment `zeroCount`
4. **Contract window**: If `zeroCount` exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer until we have at most `k` zeros
5. **Track maximum**: At each step, update the maximum window size seen so far
6. **Continue**: Repeat until `right` reaches the end of array

## Algorithm
1. Use two pointers `left` and `right` to maintain a sliding window
2. Expand the window by moving `right` pointer and count zeros encountered
3. When zero count exceeds `k`, shrink the window from left until zero count becomes `k` or less
4. Keep track of the maximum window size throughout the process
5. Return the maximum window size as the answer

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is visited at most twice (once by right pointer, once by left pointer)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables

## Summary
The **sliding window approach** works because it efficiently maintains a valid window containing at most `k` zeros while maximizing the window size. The key insight is that we don't need to check all possible subarrays - we can use the two-pointer technique to find the optimal solution in linear time. **Corner cases** include when `k` is 0 (find longest existing sequence of 1's) and when `k` is greater than or equal to the number of zeros (entire array can be converted to 1's).
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxOnes(int arr[], int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;
        int zeroCount = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
            if (arr[right] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }

            while (zeroCount > k) {
                if (arr[left] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
