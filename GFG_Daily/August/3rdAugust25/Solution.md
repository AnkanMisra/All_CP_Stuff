# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to use a **2D differencez array** technique instead of directly updating each cell in the submatrix for every operation. This approach transforms multiple range updates into a single pass computation, significantly improving efficiency from `O(q * n * m)` to `O(q + n * m)`.

## Approach
The **2D difference array** works on the principle that we can represent range updates as point updates in a difference array, then reconstruct the final result using prefix sums.

1. **Create a difference array**: Initialize a 2D difference array `diff[][]` of size `(n+1) × (m+1)` with all zeros.

2. **Apply operations on difference array**: For each operation `[v, r1, c1, r2, c2]`, instead of updating the entire submatrix, we make **four point updates** in the difference array:
   - Add `v` at `diff[r1][c1]`
   - Subtract `v` at `diff[r1][c2+1]`
   - Subtract `v` at `diff[r2+1][c1]`
   - Add `v` at `diff[r2+1][c2+1]`

3. **Compute prefix sums**: Apply 2D prefix sum on the difference array to get the actual increments for each cell.

4. **Add to original matrix**: Add the computed increments to the original matrix to get the final result.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `diff[][]` array of size `(n+1) × (m+1)` with zeros
2. For each operation `[v, r1, c1, r2, c2]`:
   - `diff[r1][c1] += v`
   - `diff[r1][c2+1] -= v`
   - `diff[r2+1][c1] -= v`
   - `diff[r2+1][c2+1] += v`
3. Compute 2D prefix sum on `diff[][]`:
   - For `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - For `j` from `0` to `m-1`:
       - `diff[i][j] += diff[i-1][j] + diff[i][j-1] - diff[i-1][j-1]`
4. Add `diff[i][j]` to `mat[i][j]` for all valid `i, j`
5. Return the updated matrix

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(q + n * m)` where `q` is the number of operations
  - `O(q)` for processing all operations
  - `O(n * m)` for computing 2D prefix sum and final result
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * m)` for the difference array

## Summary
The **2D difference array** technique efficiently handles multiple range updates by converting them into point updates and using prefix sums to reconstruct the final result. This approach is particularly effective when the number of operations is large, as it avoids the need to update each cell individually for every operation. The key insight is that **range updates in the original array become point updates in the difference array**, and the final result can be obtained through 2D prefix sum computation.
