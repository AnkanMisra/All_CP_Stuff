# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
This is a classic **"maximize the minimum"** optimization problem. The key insight is that we want to **distribute our watering optimally** to ensure the smallest flower height is as large as possible. Since we can only water `w` continuous flowers per day, we need to use **binary search on the answer** combined with a **greedy validation strategy** using difference arrays.

## Approach
The solution uses **binary search** on the possible minimum height values. For each candidate minimum height, we check if it's achievable within `k` days using a **greedy watering strategy with difference array optimization**.

**Binary Search Range:**
- **Lower bound:** Current minimum height in the array
- **Upper bound:** Current minimum height + `k` (maximum possible increase with k days)

**Greedy Validation with Difference Array:**
For a given target minimum height, we scan the array from left to right using a **difference array technique**. We maintain a running sum of water applied and when a flower's height (including accumulated water) is less than target, we **immediately apply the needed water** starting from that position for `w` continuous flowers. The difference array helps efficiently track when watering effects end.

## Algorithm
1. **Initialize binary search** bounds: `left = min(arr)`, `right = min(arr) + k`
2. For each `mid` value in binary search:
   - Create a **difference array** `water[]` of size `n+1`
   - Initialize `ops = 0` (operations used) and `currWater = 0` (accumulated water)
   - **Scan from left to right**:
     - Add `water[i]` to `currWater` (apply pending water effects)
     - Calculate current height: `arr[i] + currWater`
     - If `height < mid`, calculate `need = mid - height`
     - Add `need` to `ops` and `currWater`
     - Set `water[i + w] -= need` to end watering effect after `w` positions
     - If `ops > k`, return `false`
   - If all flowers meet target with `ops â‰¤ k`, return `true`
3. **Return the maximum achievable minimum height**

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(k))` where `n` is the array size
  - Binary search runs in `O(log(k))` iterations
  - Each validation takes `O(n)` time to scan the array
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the difference array during validation

## Summary
The solution works because the **greedy strategy with difference arrays is optimal** for this problem. When we need to raise a flower's height to meet the minimum requirement, it's always best to **water it immediately** along with the next `w-1` flowers. The difference array technique efficiently handles the **range updates** for watering effects, ensuring we can simulate the watering process in linear time. This approach guarantees we use the minimum number of operations and find the maximum achievable minimum height.
