# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

We need to count the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` is from `mat1` and `b` is from `mat2` and `a + b == x`. Both matrices are sorted in a strictly ascending order (flattened, they are sorted arrays). This allows us to use a two-pointer approach similar to the "two sum in two sorted arrays" problem.

### Approach

- Treat both matrices as flattened sorted arrays.
- Use two pointers:
  - One pointer (`i1`, `a`) starts from the beginning of `mat1`.
  - The other pointer (`i2`, `b`) starts from the end of `mat2`.
- At each step, compute the sum of the current elements.
  - If the sum equals `x`, increment the count and move both pointers.
  - If the sum is less than `x`, move the pointer in `mat1` forward.
  - If the sum is greater than `x`, move the pointer in `mat2` backward.
- Adjust the row and column indices as you traverse the matrices.

### Code

class Solution {
    int countPairs(int[][] mat1, int[][] mat2, int x){
        int n = mat1.length, cnt = 0;
        int a = 0, b = n - 1, i1 = 0, i2 = n - 1;
        while (i2 >= 0 && i1 < n) {
            int sum = mat1[i1][a] + mat2[i2][b];
            if (sum == x) {
                cnt++;
                a++;
                b--;
            } else if (sum < x) {
                a++;
            } else {
                b--;
            }
            if (a == n) {
                a = 0;
                i1++;
            }
            if (b == -1) {
                i2--;
                b = n - 1;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), since each matrix has n^2 elements and each element is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a few pointers and counters are used.

### Summary

- The solution uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently count valid pairs.
- It leverages the sorted property of both matrices to avoid brute-force checking of all pairs.
- The approach is optimal for the given constraints.
