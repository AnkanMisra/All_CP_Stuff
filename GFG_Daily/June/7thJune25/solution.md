# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for the longest subarray (span) where the sum of elements in two binary arrays is the same. The key insight is that if the difference between the prefix sums of the two arrays is the same at two indices, then the subarray between those indices has equal sums in both arrays.

## Approach
- Traverse both arrays simultaneously, maintaining running sums (`s1` for `a1` and `s2` for `a2`).
- For each index, calculate the difference `diff = s1 - s2`.
- If `diff` is zero, it means the sums are equal from the start up to the current index, so update the answer to `i + 1`.
- Use a hash map to store the first occurrence of each `diff`. If the same `diff` is seen again at index `i`, it means the subarray between the previous index and `i` has equal sums in both arrays. Update the answer with the length of this span.
- If a `diff` is seen for the first time, store its index in the map.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the arrays, since we traverse the arrays once and all hash map operations are O(1) on average.
- Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the hash map of differences.

## Summary
By tracking the difference between prefix sums and using a hash map to remember the first occurrence of each difference, we can efficiently find the longest span where the sums of the two arrays are equal.
