# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To find the `k` closest elements to `x` in a sorted array (excluding `x` itself), we can use a two-pointer approach. Since the array is sorted, we can efficiently find the position where `x` would be inserted and then expand outwards to collect the closest elements.

## Approach
- Use binary search to find the index where `x` would be inserted in the array.
- Set two pointers: `i` to the left of `x`'s position, and `j` to the right (or at the position if `x` is not present).
- If `x` is present in the array, skip it by moving `j` one step to the right.
- At each step, compare the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `x`, and `arr[j]` and `x`:
  - If `arr[i]` is closer, add it to the answer and move `i` left.
  - If `arr[j]` is closer, add it to the answer and move `j` right.
  - If both are equally close, prefer the larger element (i.e., `arr[j]`), as per the problem statement.
- Continue until `k` elements are collected.
- If one pointer goes out of bounds, continue with the other pointer.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n + k), where n is the length of the array. O(log n) for binary search and O(k) for collecting the closest elements.
- Space Complexity: O(k) for the output list.

## Summary
By using binary search and a two-pointer approach, we efficiently find the `k` closest elements to `x` in the required order, handling all tie-breaking and exclusion rules as specified.
