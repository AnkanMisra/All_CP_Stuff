# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks for all possible ways to partition a given string `s` such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using backtracking. The core idea is to explore all possible substrings starting from the current position, check if they are palindromes, and if so, recursively solve for the remainder of the string.

## Approach
- Use a recursive backtracking function.
- The backtracking function takes the current starting index in the string, the string itself, a list to store the current partition, and a list to store all valid results.
- **Base Case**: If the `start` index reaches the end of the string, it means a valid partition has been formed. Add a copy of the `current` partition to the `result` list.
- **Recursive Step**: Iterate from `end = start` to `s.length() - 1`.
    - For each `end`, consider the substring `s[start...end]`.
    - Check if this substring is a palindrome using a helper function `isPalindrome`.
    - If it is a palindrome:
        - Add this substring to the `current` partition.
        - Recursively call the backtracking function with `start = end + 1` (to find partitions for the rest of the string).
        - **Backtrack**: After the recursive call returns, remove the last added substring from `current`. This is crucial to explore other possibilities.

## Algorithm
1.  **`palinParts(String s)` function**:
    *   Initialize `result = new ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>()`.
    *   Call `backtrack(0, s, new ArrayList<String>(), result)`.
    *   Return `result`.

2.  **`backtrack(int start, String s, ArrayList<String> current, ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> result)` function**:
    *   If `start == s.length()`:
        *   `result.add(new ArrayList<>(current))` (add a new copy to avoid modification issues).
        *   `return`.
    *   For `end` from `start` to `s.length() - 1`:
        *   If `isPalindrome(s, start, end)`:
            *   `current.add(s.substring(start, end + 1))`.
            *   `backtrack(end + 1, s, current, result)`.
            *   `current.remove(current.size() - 1)` (backtrack).

3.  **`isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right)` helper function**:
    *   While `left < right`:
        *   If `s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)`, return `false`.
        *   Increment `left`, decrement `right`.
    *   Return `true`.

## Complexity
-   **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N) in the worst case.
    *   `N` is the length of the string.
    *   In the worst case (e.g., all 'a's), every single character is a palindrome, leading to `2^(N-1)` possible partitions.
    *   For each partition, we perform palindrome checks (O(N) per check) and substring operations. The `isPalindrome` check takes O(N) time. There are `O(2^N)` potential partitions to build.
-   **Space Complexity**: O(N)
    *   The recursion depth is at most `N`.
    *   `current` list stores at most `N` substrings.
    *   The total space for `result` depends on the number of partitions, which can be `O(2^N)` in the worst case, but the question implies output space is not counted.

## Summary
The solution uses a standard backtracking algorithm. It systematically explores all possible substrings from the current position, and if a substring is a palindrome, it considers that as a valid segment and recursively solves for the rest of the string. This ensures that all valid palindromic partitions are found. The constraint `s.size() <= 20` makes this exponential time complexity feasible.
