# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
A dead end in a BST is a leaf node such that no new node can be inserted at or below this node, given all node values must be greater than 0. This happens when the range of valid values for a node collapses to a single value (i.e., `mini == maxi`), meaning no further insertion is possible.

## Approach
- Use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the BST.
- For each node, keep track of the minimum (`mini`) and maximum (`maxi`) values that can be inserted in its subtree.
- At each leaf node, if `mini == maxi`, it means this node is a dead end.
- Recursively check the left and right subtrees, updating the valid range accordingly:
  - For the left child, the valid range is `[mini, root.data - 1]`.
  - For the right child, the valid range is `[root.data + 1, maxi]`.
- If any leaf node is a dead end, return `true`.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST, since each node is visited once.
- Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## Summary
By recursively checking the valid insertion range for each node, the solution efficiently detects if any leaf node is a dead end, ensuring correctness for all BSTs with unique positive integers.
