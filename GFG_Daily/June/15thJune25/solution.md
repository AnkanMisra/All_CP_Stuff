# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
We are asked to find the smallest divisor such that the sum of the ceilings of each array element divided by this divisor is less than or equal to `k`. As the divisor increases, the sum decreases, so we can use binary search to efficiently find the smallest valid divisor.

## Approach
- Use binary search on the possible divisor values, starting from 1 up to the maximum value in the array.
- For each candidate divisor, calculate the sum of the ceilings of each array element divided by this divisor.
- If the sum is greater than `k`, increase the divisor (search right).
- If the sum is less than or equal to `k`, record the divisor as a possible answer and try to find a smaller one (search left).
- Continue until the smallest valid divisor is found.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log m), where n is the length of the array and m is the maximum value in the array. Each binary search step takes O(n) time to check, and there are O(log m) steps.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as only a few variables are used.

## Summary
By using binary search on the divisor and checking the sum condition for each candidate, we efficiently find the smallest divisor that satisfies the problem's requirements.
