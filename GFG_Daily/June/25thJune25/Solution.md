# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks if it's possible to remove at most one character from the string so that all remaining characters have the same frequency. The key insight is that, after removing at most one character, there can be at most two different frequencies among the characters, and one of them must be "fixable" by a single removal.

## Approach
1. **Count Frequencies:**  
   - Use a HashMap to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Analyze Frequencies:**  
   - There can be at most two different frequencies among the characters.
   - If all frequencies are the same, return true.
   - If there are two frequencies:
     - If one frequency is 1 and it occurs only once, removing that character makes all frequencies equal.
     - If the difference between the two frequencies is 1 and the higher frequency occurs only once, removing one occurrence of that character makes all frequencies equal.
   - If there are more than two frequencies, return false.
3. **Return the Result:**  
   - Return true if any of the above conditions are satisfied, otherwise return false.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string (for counting and analyzing frequencies).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (since there are at most 26 lowercase letters).

## Summary
**By counting character frequencies and checking the possible cases for making all frequencies equal with at most one removal, we can efficiently determine if the condition can be met.**  
This approach is optimal for the given constraints.

```java
class Solution {
    boolean sameFreq(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char ch: s.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(ch, freq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int freq1 = -1;
        int freq2 = -1;
        
        int c1 = 0, c2 = 0;
        
        for (char ch: freq.keySet()) {
            int value = freq.get(ch);
            
            if (freq1 == -1) {
                freq1 = value;
                c1 = 1;
            } else if (freq1 == value) {
                c1 += 1;
            } else if (freq2 == -1) {
                freq2 = value;
                c2 = 1;
            } else if (freq2 == value) {
                c2 += 1;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        if (freq2 == -1) return true;
        
        if ((freq1 == 1 && c1 == 1) || (freq2 == 1 && c2 == 1)) return true;
        
        if (c1 == 1 && freq1 - 1 == freq2) return true;
        if (c2 == 1 && freq2 - 1 == freq1) return true;
        
        return false;
    }
}
