## Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks whether it is possible to rearrange the balls into groups of size **k** such that each group contains consecutive integers. The key insight is that, after sorting or counting the balls, we can greedily try to form groups starting from the smallest available number.

If at any point we cannot form a group of size **k** with consecutive numbers (because some number is missing or not enough copies are available), the answer is **false**.

## Approach
1. **Check Divisibility:**  
   If the total number of balls is not divisible by **k**, it is impossible to form the required groups, so return **false** immediately.
2. **Count Occurrences:**  
   Use a sorted map (TreeMap) to count the frequency of each number in the array. This allows us to always process the smallest available number first.
3. **Greedy Grouping:**  
   - For each unique number in increasing order:
     - If its count is zero, skip it.
     - Otherwise, try to form a group starting from this number up to (number + k - 1).
     - For each number in this range, check if there are enough balls to match the current frequency. If not, return **false**.
     - Subtract the used balls from the count for each number in the group.
4. **Return the Result:**  
   If all groups are successfully formed, return **true**.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the array (due to TreeMap operations).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the counts.

## Summary
**By greedily forming groups of consecutive numbers starting from the smallest available, and using a frequency map, we can efficiently determine if the grouping is possible.**  
If at any point a group cannot be formed, we return false; otherwise, we return true.

```java
class Solution{
public boolean validgroup(int[] arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.length;
    if (n % k != 0) return false;
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new TreeMap<>();
    for (int num : arr) {
        count.put(num, count.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (int num : count.keySet()) {
        int freq = count.get(num);
        if (freq == 0) continue;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int curr = num + i;
            if (count.getOrDefault(curr, 0) < freq) return false;
            count.put(curr, count.get(curr) - freq);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
}
