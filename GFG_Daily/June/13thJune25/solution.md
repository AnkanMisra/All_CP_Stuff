# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem is to find the minimum eating speed `s` such that Koko can finish all banana piles within `k` hours. Since a higher speed always allows Koko to finish faster, we can use binary search to efficiently find the smallest valid `s`.

## Approach
- Use binary search on the possible values of `s` (from 1 to the largest pile size).
- For each candidate speed `s`, calculate the total hours needed to finish all piles at that speed:
  - For each pile, the number of hours needed is `ceil(pile / s)`.
  - Sum these hours for all piles.
- If the total hours is less than or equal to `k`, try a smaller speed.
- If the total hours is more than `k`, try a larger speed.
- The answer is the smallest speed for which Koko can finish within `k` hours.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n log m), where n is the number of piles and m is the maximum pile size. Each binary search step takes O(n) time to check, and there are O(log m) steps.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as only a few variables are used.

## Summary
By using binary search on the eating speed and simulating the process for each candidate speed, we efficiently find the minimum speed required for Koko to finish all the bananas within the given time.
