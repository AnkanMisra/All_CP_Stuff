# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem requires sorting the uppercase and lowercase letters of a string **separately**, while preserving the original case positions. That is, if a character at position i was uppercase in the original string, it must remain uppercase in the output (but possibly a different uppercase letter), and similarly for lowercase.

The key insight is to:
- Collect all uppercase and lowercase letters into separate lists.
- Sort each list independently.
- Reconstruct the string by placing sorted uppercase letters in the original uppercase positions and sorted lowercase letters in the original lowercase positions.

## Approach
1. **Separate Characters by Case:**  
   Iterate through the string and collect all uppercase letters into one list and all lowercase letters into another.
2. **Sort Each List:**  
   Sort the list of uppercase letters and the list of lowercase letters independently.
3. **Reconstruct the String:**  
   Iterate through the original string. For each character:
   - If it was uppercase, take the next character from the sorted uppercase list.
   - If it was lowercase, take the next character from the sorted lowercase list.
   - Append the chosen character to the result.
4. **Return the Result:**  
   The result is the case-specific sorted string.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the string. This is due to sorting the uppercase and lowercase lists, each of which can be up to n in size.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the separated lists and the result.

## Summary
**This approach ensures that the relative positions of uppercase and lowercase letters are preserved, while each group is sorted among itself.**  
It is efficient and works for large strings due to the linear scan and efficient sorting.

```java
class Solution {
    public static String caseSort(String s) {

        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        List<Character> upper = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Character> lower = new ArrayList<>();
        // Separate uppercase and lowercase characters
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') lower.add(c);
            else upper.add(c);
        }
        // Sort both lists
        Collections.sort(upper);
        Collections.sort(lower);
        int i = 0, n = s.length(), j = 0, k = 0;
        // Reconstruct the result string
        while (i < n) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
                res.append(upper.get(j++));
            } else {
                res.append(lower.get(k++));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
