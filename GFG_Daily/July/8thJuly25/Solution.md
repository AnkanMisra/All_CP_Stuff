# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The main idea is to use the frequency of each element to determine, for every position, the closest element to its right that appears more frequently in the array. We can efficiently find this using a stack, similar to the "next greater element" pattern, but comparing frequencies instead of values.

## Approach
- **Count the frequency** of each element in the array using a hash map.
- **Iterate from right to left** through the array, maintaining a stack to keep track of potential candidates for the next element with a higher frequency.
- For each element:
  - **Pop elements from the stack** as long as their frequency is less than or equal to the current element's frequency.
  - The top of the stack (if any) will be the next element to the right with a higher frequency; if the stack is empty, use `-1`.
  - **Push the current element** onto the stack for future comparisons.
- **Reverse the result** at the end since we processed the array from right to left.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, and frequency counting is also linear.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — For the frequency map, stack, and result array.

## Summary
This approach efficiently finds the next element with a higher frequency for each position by leveraging a stack and a frequency map. It works in linear time and handles all edge cases, such as when no such element exists (output `-1`). The key insight is to compare frequencies rather than values, adapting the classic next greater element technique.
