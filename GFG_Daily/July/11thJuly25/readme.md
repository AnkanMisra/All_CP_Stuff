## Problem Description
Given an integer `n`, count the number of binary strings of length `n` that contain **at least one pair of consecutive 1's**. A binary string is a sequence made up of only `0` and `1`.

## Input Format
- **A single integer** `n` — the length of the binary string.

## Output Format
- **A single integer** — the number of binary strings of length `n` that contain at least one pair of consecutive 1's.

## Examples

### Input
`n = 2`<br/>

### Output
`1`<br/>

### Input
`n = 3`<br/>

### Output
`3`<br/>

### Input
`n = 5`<br/>

### Output
`19`<br/>

## Constraints
- **2 ≤ n ≤ 30**

## Notes
- Only binary strings with **at least one pair of consecutive 1's** are counted.
- For example, for `n = 2`, the valid string is `11`. For `n = 3`, the valid strings are `011`, `110`, and `111`.
