# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that a string is valid only if **all its prefixes** are also present in the array. By building up from the shortest strings and checking prefixes, we can efficiently find the longest valid string.

## Approach
- **Sort the array** of strings lexicographically. This ensures that, for strings of the same length, the lexicographically smaller one comes first.
- Use a **set** to keep track of all strings that are valid (i.e., all their prefixes are present).
- Iterate through each string in the sorted array:
  - If the string has length `1`, or if its **immediate prefix** (the substring without the last character) is already in the set, then this string is valid.
  - Add valid strings to the set.
  - For each valid string, check if it is **longer** than the current answer, or if it is the same length but **lexicographically smaller**. If so, update the answer.
- After processing all strings, the answer will be the **longest valid string** with all prefixes present.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m + n log n)` where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average string length. Sorting takes `O(n log n)`, and checking prefixes and set operations take `O(n * m)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * m)` for storing the set of valid strings.

## Summary
This approach works because it builds valid strings incrementally, always ensuring that all prefixes are present before considering a string as a candidate. Sorting ensures that, in case of ties, the lexicographically smallest string is chosen. The use of a set allows for efficient prefix checks and guarantees correctness for all edge cases, including multiple valid answers and single-character strings.
