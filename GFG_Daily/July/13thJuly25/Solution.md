# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The main idea is to find the **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** in the array and then calculate the sum of all elements **not included in any LIS**. Since there may be multiple LIS, we want to maximize the sum of elements not in the LIS, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum of one possible LIS.

## Approach
- For each element in the array, compute the length and minimum sum of the LIS ending at that element.
- Use dynamic programming:
  - `lisLen[i]`: Length of the LIS ending at index `i`.
  - `lisSum[i]`: Minimum sum of an LIS ending at index `i`.
- For each `i`, check all previous `j < i`:
  - If `arr[j] < arr[i]`, try to extend the LIS from `j` to `i`.
  - Update `lisLen[i]` and `lisSum[i]` accordingly, always keeping the minimum sum for the maximum length.
- After filling the arrays, find the **maximum LIS length** and the **minimum sum** among all LIS of that length.
- The answer is the **total sum of the array minus the minimum sum of the LIS**.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

## Summary
By using dynamic programming to track both the length and minimum sum of the LIS ending at each position, we ensure that we find the LIS with the smallest possible sum. Subtracting this from the total sum gives the **maximum sum of elements not part of any LIS**. This approach efficiently handles all cases, including arrays with multiple LIS or strictly decreasing sequences.
