# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To efficiently find the top `k` maximum sum combinations from two arrays, we avoid brute-forcing all possible pairs. Instead, we use a **max-heap** to always extract the current largest possible sum, and a set to avoid revisiting the same index pairs.

## Approach
- **Sort** both arrays `a[]` and `b[]` in ascending order.
- Use a **max-heap** (priority queue) to keep track of the largest unprocessed sum combinations, along with their indices.
- Start by pushing the sum of the largest elements (`a[n-1] + b[n-1]`) and their indices into the heap.
- Use a **set** to track visited index pairs to avoid duplicates.
- While fewer than `k` results have been collected:
  - Pop the largest sum from the heap and add it to the result list.
  - For the current indices `(i, j)`, push the next two possible combinations `(i-1, j)` and `(i, j-1)` into the heap if they haven't been visited.
- Continue until `k` sums are collected.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: **O(k log k)** (since each heap operation is `O(log k)` and we do at most `k` operations)
- Space Complexity: **O(k)** (for the heap and the visited set)

## Summary
This approach efficiently finds the top `k` maximum sum combinations by always expanding the next largest possible sum and avoiding duplicate work. It leverages the properties of a max-heap and a visited set to ensure optimal performance, making it suitable for large input sizes. The key insight is to only consider the next best candidates at each step, rather than all possible pairs.
