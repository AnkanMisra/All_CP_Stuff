# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that for any subarray of size at least 2, the maximum sum of the two smallest elements is always achieved by some pair of adjacent elements in the array. This is because, in any subarray, the two smallest elements will be adjacent somewhere, and their sum will be considered.

## Approach
- **Iterate through the array** and for each pair of adjacent elements, calculate their sum.
- **Track the maximum sum** found among all adjacent pairs.
- **Return the maximum sum** as the answer, since it represents the largest possible sum of the two smallest elements in any subarray of size at least 2.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (where `n` is the length of the array, since we check each adjacent pair once)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (no extra space is used apart from a few variables)

## Summary
- The approach works because the two smallest elements in any subarray are always adjacent somewhere in the array, so checking all adjacent pairs suffices.
- This method is **efficient** and handles large arrays within the constraints.
- **Corner case:** Arrays of size exactly 2 are handled naturally, as there is only one pair to consider.
