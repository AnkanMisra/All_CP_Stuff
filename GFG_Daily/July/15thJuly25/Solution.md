# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
To check if a **very large number** (given as a string) is **divisible by 13**, we can simulate the process of dividing the number by 13 digit by digit, just as we do manually, to avoid integer overflow.

## Approach
- Initialize a variable `remainder` to `0`.
- Traverse each character (digit) in the string `s` from left to right.
- For each digit, update the `remainder` as: `remainder = (remainder * 10 + digit) % 13`.
- After processing all digits, if `remainder` is `0`, the number is **divisible by 13**; otherwise, it is not.
- This approach works for numbers of any length, since we never store the entire number as an integer.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (constant extra space).

## Summary
- By processing the number digit by digit and maintaining only the current `remainder`, we can efficiently check divisibility by 13 for **very large numbers**.
- This method avoids overflow and works for any input size within the constraints.
- **Key insight:** Simulate the division process using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers represented as strings.
