# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is to **identify all rows and columns that contain zeros** before modifying the matrix. If we modify the matrix while scanning, we might incorrectly mark additional rows and columns as zero. Therefore, we need to **store the positions of zeros first**, then apply the modifications.

## Approach
The solution uses a **two-pass approach** with auxiliary data structures:

1. **First Pass - Identification**: Traverse the entire matrix and identify all rows and columns that contain at least one zero. Store these row and column indices in separate `HashSet` collections.

2. **Second Pass - Modification**: Traverse the matrix again and set any element to zero if its row index or column index is present in the respective sets.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize two `HashSet` collections: one for storing row indices (`row`) and another for column indices (`columns`)
2. Iterate through the matrix with nested loops
3. For each element `mat[i][j]` that equals zero, add `i` to the row set and `j` to the columns set
4. Iterate through the matrix again with nested loops
5. For each position `(i, j)`, if either `i` is in the row set OR `j` is in the columns set, set `mat[i][j] = 0`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. We traverse the matrix twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n + m)` for storing the row and column indices in the HashSets. In the worst case, all rows and columns might contain zeros.

## Summary
This approach works because it **separates the identification phase from the modification phase**, preventing false positives. The use of `HashSet` provides `O(1)` average lookup time, making the solution efficient. The algorithm handles all corner cases including matrices with all zeros, no zeros, or zeros at boundaries.
