## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
m = 6, n = 3, x = 12

**Output:**  
25

**Explanation:**  
There are 25 total ways to get the sum 12 using 3 dice with faces from 1 to 6.

### Example 2

**Input:**  
m = 2, n = 3, x = 6

**Output:**  
1

**Explanation:**  
There is only 1 way to get the sum 6 using 3 dice with faces from 1 to 2. All the dice will have to land on 2.
