# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

To insert a new node into a sorted circular linked list while maintaining the sorted order, we need to find the correct position where the new node's value fits between two existing nodes. Since the list is circular, we must also handle the case where the new value is the new minimum or maximum.

### Approach

- Start from the head and traverse the list to find the correct position to insert the new node.
- If the new value is less than the head's value, it should become the new head.
- Otherwise, find the position where the current node's value is less than or equal to the new value and the next node's value is greater than or equal to the new value, or until we loop back to the head.
- Insert the new node between `prev` and `node`.
- If the new node is the new minimum, return it as the new head; otherwise, return the original head.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public Node sortedInsert(Node head, int data) {
        Node prev = null;
        Node node = head;
        do {
            prev = node;
            node = node.next;
        } while(node != head);
        while(node.data < data) {
            node = node.next;
            prev = prev.next;
            if(node == head) {
                break;
            }
        }
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        prev.next = newNode;
        newNode.next = node;
        if(head.data > data) {
            return newNode;
        } else {
            return head;
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list (in the worst case, we may traverse the entire list).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.

### Summary

- The solution finds the correct position to insert the new node in a sorted circular linked list.
- It handles the edge case where the new node becomes the new head.
- The approach is efficient and maintains the sorted order of the list.
