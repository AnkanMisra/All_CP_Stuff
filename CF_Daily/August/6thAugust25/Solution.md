# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
This is a **dynamic programming problem** where we need to count paths in a k-tree with specific constraints. The key insight is that we can use **two DP states**: one to count all paths of weight `n`, and another to count paths that **exclude edges with weight ≥ d**. The answer is the difference between these two counts.

## Approach
We use **dynamic programming** with the state `dp[i]` representing the number of ways to achieve a total weight of `i`. The main idea is:

1. **Calculate total paths**: Count all possible paths from root with total weight `n` using edges with weights `1` to `k`
2. **Calculate restricted paths**: Count paths with total weight `n` using only edges with weights `1` to `d-1` (excluding edges ≥ d)
3. **Subtract**: The answer is total paths minus restricted paths, giving us paths that contain **at least one edge with weight ≥ d**

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `dpAll[0] = 1` (one way to achieve weight 0 - stay at root)
2. For each weight `i` from `1` to `n`:
   - For each edge weight `j` from `1` to `k`:
     - If `i >= j`, add `dpAll[i-j]` to `dpAll[i]`
3. Initialize `dpSmall[0] = 1` for the restricted case
4. For each weight `i` from `1` to `n`:
   - For each edge weight `j` from `1` to `d-1`:
     - If `i >= j`, add `dpSmall[i-j]` to `dpSmall[i]`
5. Return `(dpAll[n] - dpSmall[n]) % MOD`

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n × k)` where we iterate through all weights up to `n` and for each weight, we consider all possible edge weights up to `k`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the DP arrays

## Summary
The solution works by using the **principle of inclusion-exclusion**. We count all possible paths and subtract those that don't satisfy our constraint (paths without any edge ≥ d). This approach efficiently handles the constraint of having **at least one edge with weight ≥ d** by computing its complement. The DP transition represents adding one more edge to extend existing paths, and the modular arithmetic ensures we handle large numbers correctly.
