# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that the factorial of each digit can be represented as a product of factorials of smaller digits, and by decomposing certain digits into their prime factorial components, we can maximize the resulting number. To get the largest possible number (with no 0 or 1 digits), we should replace each digit with a set of digits whose factorials multiply to the same value, then sort all resulting digits in descending order.

## Approach
- **Ignore** digits `0` and `1` since their factorial is `1` and they are not allowed in the answer.
- **Replace** each digit with a set of digits such that the product of their factorials equals the original digit's factorial, and all are greater than `1`:
  - `2`, `3`, `5`, `7` remain as themselves.
  - `4` → `322` (since `4! = 2! * 2! * 3!`)
  - `6` → `53` (since `6! = 5! * 3!`)
  - `8` → `7222` (since `8! = 7! * 2! * 2! * 2!`)
  - `9` → `7332` (since `9! = 7! * 3! * 3! * 2!`)
- **Collect** all resulting digits from the replacements.
- **Sort** all digits in descending order to form the largest possible number.
- **Output** the resulting number as the answer.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)` (where `n` is the number of digits, due to sorting)
- Space Complexity: `O(n)` (for storing the resulting digits)

## Summary
By decomposing each digit into a set of digits whose factorials multiply to the same value, and then sorting all resulting digits in descending order, we ensure the answer is the largest possible number with no `0` or `1` digits. This approach leverages the properties of factorials and prime factorization to maximize the result while satisfying all problem constraints.
