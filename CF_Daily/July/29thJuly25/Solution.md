## Intuition
The key insight is that we can add powers of 2 to array elements in each second. Since we can add `2^(x-1)` in the `x`-th second, we're essentially working with **binary representation**. To make the array nondecreasing, we need to ensure each element `a[i]` is at least as large as `a[i-1]`. The **minimum number of seconds needed** is determined by the **largest deficit** any element has compared to its required minimum value.

## Approach
1. **Calculate required values**: For each position `i`, determine the minimum value `a[i]` should have to maintain nondecreasing order. This is `max(a[i], required[i-1])` where `required[i-1]` is the minimum value needed at position `i-1`.

2. **Find deficits**: For each position, calculate how much we need to add: `deficit = required[i] - a[i]`.

3. **Convert to binary representation**: Since we can add `2^(x-1)` in the `x`-th second, the number of seconds needed for each deficit is the **position of the highest set bit** in the deficit's binary representation.

4. **Find maximum**: The answer is the **maximum number of seconds** needed across all positions.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize `required[0] = a[0]` (first element doesn't need to change relative to previous)
2. For each position `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
   - Calculate `required[i] = max(a[i], required[i-1])`
   - Calculate `deficit = required[i] - a[i]`
   - If `deficit > 0`, find the number of bits needed: `ceil(log2(deficit + 1))`
3. Return the maximum number of bits needed across all positions

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log(max_value))` where `max_value` is the maximum possible deficit
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` excluding input storage

## Summary
This approach works because we're essentially **building up each element using powers of 2** to reach the required minimum value. The number of seconds needed corresponds to the **highest bit position** required in the binary representation of the deficit. The key insight is that we process elements left to right, ensuring each element is at least as large as the previous required value, and track the maximum time needed across all positions.
