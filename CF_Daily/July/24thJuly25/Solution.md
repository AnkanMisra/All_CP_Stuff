# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The core idea is to find the **longest chain** of models where each subsequent model's index is a **multiple** of the previous one's index, and their sizes are **strictly increasing**. This can be modeled as a **dynamic programming** problem on the positions treated as indices starting from `1`.

## Approach
We use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the **maximum chain length** ending at position `i` (0-based). For each position `i`, we check all possible previous positions `j` (where `(i+1)` is divisible by `(j+1)` and `j < i`) and if `s[j] < s[i]`, we update `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. The answer is the maximum value in the `dp` array.

To efficiently find previous positions, we enumerate the **divisors** of `(i+1)`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n sqrt(n))` due to divisor enumeration for each position.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the `dp` array.

## Summary
This approach works because it builds the longest chain by considering all valid previous positions via divisors, ensuring the divisibility and increasing size conditions are met. Key takeaways include efficient divisor enumeration to handle the constraints, and handling single-model chains as base cases. Corner cases like all sizes equal or decreasing result in a maximum of `1`.
