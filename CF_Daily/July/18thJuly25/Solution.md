# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The core idea is to find the **shortest path** between the initial and final centers of the circle and cover that distance using the **most efficient single move**. The maximum distance the circle's center can be displaced in one step is equal to its **diameter** (`2 * r`). This is achieved by placing a pin on the circle's circumference and rotating it 180 degrees around the pin. Therefore, the problem is simplified to calculating how many of these maximum-length "jumps" are needed to cover the total distance.

## Approach
1.  First, calculate the **Euclidean distance** `d` between the starting center `(x, y)` and the destination center `(x', y')`. The formula for the distance is `d = sqrt((x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2)`.
2.  Next, determine the **maximum distance** the center can move in a single step. This distance is the diameter of the circle, which is `2 * r`.
3.  The minimum number of steps is the total distance `d` divided by the maximum distance per step (`2 * r`).
4.  Since we need an integer number of steps and even a small remaining distance requires a full step, we use the **ceiling function** to round up the result. The formula is `steps = ceil(d / (2.0 * r))`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - The solution involves a constant number of arithmetic operations, regardless of the input values.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - A fixed amount of memory is used to store the coordinates, radius, and intermediate calculations.

## Summary
The approach is effective because it correctly models the problem as covering a total distance with fixed-length steps. By calculating the straight-line distance between the two points and dividing it by the maximum possible displacement per move (the diameter), we find the most efficient path. Using the ceiling function ensures that the destination is always reached, making it the **minimum number of steps required**. If the start and end points are identical, the distance is `0`, correctly resulting in `0` steps.
