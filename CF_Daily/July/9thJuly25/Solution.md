# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The key insight is that to maximize the median, we should focus all our allowed increases on the elements at or above the current median position. Since only increases are allowed, the optimal way is to raise the median and the elements after it as much as possible, using at most `k` total operations.

## Approach
- **Sort the array** to easily identify the median and the elements after it.
- The median is at index `n / 2` (0-based) after sorting.
- Use **binary search** to find the maximum value `m` such that we can make the median at least `m` using at most `k` operations:
  - For a candidate median value `m`, calculate the total number of increases needed to make all elements from the median position to the end at least `m`.
  - If the total required increases is less than or equal to `k`, it is possible to achieve median `m`.
  - Otherwise, try a smaller value.
- The answer is the largest `m` for which the total increases do not exceed `k`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log(max_k))` where `max_k` is the range of possible median values (up to `k` above the current median)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the array

## Summary
- The approach works because only the elements at or above the median affect the median value in a sorted array of odd length.
- By using binary search, we efficiently find the highest achievable median within the allowed number of operations.
- **Corner cases:** The method handles cases where all increases are spent on a single element or distributed among several, and works for all valid input sizes and values.
