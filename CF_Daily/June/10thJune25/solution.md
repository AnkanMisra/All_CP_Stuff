# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The cost of each banana increases linearly: the first banana costs `k`, the second `2k`, ..., the w-th banana costs `w*k`. The total cost is the sum of the first `w` natural numbers, each multiplied by `k`. The soldier needs to borrow money only if his current amount is less than the total cost.

## Approach
- Calculate the total cost using the formula for the sum of the first `w` natural numbers:  
  `total_cost = k * (1 + 2 + ... + w) = k * (w * (w + 1) / 2)`
- Subtract the amount the soldier already has (`n`) from the total cost.
- If the result is positive, that's the amount to borrow. If it's zero or negative, the soldier doesn't need to borrow any money.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(1), as all operations are simple arithmetic.
- Space Complexity: O(1).

## Summary
By using the arithmetic series formula, we efficiently compute the total cost and determine how much the soldier needs to borrow, if any.
