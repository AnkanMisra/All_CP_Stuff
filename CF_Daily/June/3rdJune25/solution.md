# Solution Explanation

### Intuition

The problem asks for the maximum alternating sum along any vertical path from each vertex in a tree. The alternating sum is defined as adding and subtracting the danger values of the vertices along the path, starting from the current vertex and moving up to the root. The challenge is to efficiently compute this value for every vertex.

### Approach

- Use BFS (or DFS) to traverse the tree from the root (vertex 1).
- For each vertex, maintain:
  - The alternating prefix sum up to that vertex.
  - The minimum and maximum prefix sums along the path to the root.
- For each vertex, the threat value is:
  - If the depth is even: `threat = prefix_sum - min_prefix_sum`
  - If the depth is odd: `threat = max_prefix_sum - prefix_sum`
- This allows us to compute the maximum alternating sum for all possible vertical paths ending at each vertex in O(n) time per test case.

### Algorithm

1. Build the tree using adjacency lists.
2. Use BFS to traverse the tree from the root.
3. For each vertex, compute its depth, alternating prefix sum, and update the minimum and maximum prefix sums.
4. Calculate the threat value for each vertex based on its depth and prefix sums.
5. Output the threat values for all vertices.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) per test case, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the tree, prefix sums, and threat values.

### Summary

- The solution efficiently computes the maximum alternating sum for each vertex using prefix sums and BFS.
- It leverages the tree structure and properties of alternating sums to avoid redundant calculations.
- The approach is optimal for the given constraints and handles large trees efficiently.
