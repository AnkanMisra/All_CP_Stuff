# Solution for 6thJune25# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem asks, for each query, what is the minimum number of elements (not equal to `k`) in a given subarray `[l, r]` that must be reordered so that a binary search for `k` in that subarray will succeed. If it is impossible, output `-1`.

The binary search process is deterministic: at each step, it checks the middle element and moves left or right depending on the comparison. For the search to succeed, `k` must be at the correct position in the subarray, and all elements that could "block" the search (i.e., cause the search to go the wrong way) must be rearranged.

## Approach
- For each query, first check if `k` is present in the subarray `[l, r]`. If not, output `-1`.
- Simulate the binary search process for `k` in `[l, r]`:
  - At each step, compare the current middle index with the index of `k`.
  - If the middle index is less than the index of `k`, all elements at the middle index that are greater than `k` would block the search and must be moved.
  - If the middle index is greater than the index of `k`, all elements at the middle index that are less than `k` would block the search and must be moved.
- Count the number of such blocking elements. This is the minimum number of elements that must be reordered.
- If the number of elements less than `k` to the left of `k` or greater than `k` to the right of `k` exceeds the available positions, output `-1`.

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(log n) per query for the binary search simulation, plus O(1) for lookups, since the permutation allows direct indexing.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the permutation and mappings.

## Summary
By simulating the binary search and counting the number of blocking elements, we can determine the minimum number of elements that must be reordered for the search to succeed, or report impossibility if the constraints cannot be satisfied.
