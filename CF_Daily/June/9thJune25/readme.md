# A. Sports Betting

## Problem Statement

Vadim made bets with `n` students, each on a specific day `ai`. For each bet, Vadim wins if he correctly predicts the boarding process on both day `ai+1` and day `ai+2`. There are two possible boarding processes each day (bus or jet bridge).

Vadim wants to guarantee that he wins at least one bet, regardless of how the boarding process actually happens. Determine if there exists a strategy for Vadim that allows him to guarantee success with at least one student.

## Input Format

- The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of students.
  - The second line contains `n` integers `a1, ..., an` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the days on which Vadim made bets with the students.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

## Output Format

For each test case, output "Yes" if Vadim can guarantee convincing at least one student, and "No" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower).

## Explanation

- In the first test case, Vadim can give each of the 4 students a different prediction for the two days after their bet, covering all 4 possible scenarios. Thus, he is guaranteed to win with at least one student.
- In the second test case, there are only 3 students, but 4 possible scenarios for two days, so Vadim cannot guarantee a win.
- In the third test case, there are 5 students, but only 4 unique days. Since some students bet on the same day, Vadim can still cover all scenarios and guarantee a win.
- In the fourth and fifth test cases, Vadim cannot guarantee a win.
