# Solution Explanation

## Intuition
For each query string `t`, we want to find the minimum number of allowed letters to append to `t` so that it is no longer a subsequence of `s`. If `t` is already not a subsequence, the answer is 0. Otherwise, the answer is the length of the shortest string (using allowed letters) that, when appended to `t`, makes the new string not a subsequence of `s`.

## Approach
- Preprocess the string `s` to quickly answer subsequence queries:
  - For each allowed letter, store the positions where it appears in `s`.
- For each query string `t`:
  - Use binary search to check if `t` is a subsequence of `s` by matching each character in order.
  - If `t` is not a subsequence, output 0.
  - If `t` is a subsequence, use a precomputed DP array `f` where `f[i]` is the minimum number of letters needed to append to a string starting from position `i` in `s` to make it not a subsequence.
  - The answer for a pleasant string is `f[pos + 1]`, where `pos` is the last matched position in `s`.

## Complexity
- Preprocessing: O(n * k), where n is the length of `s` and k is the number of allowed letters.
- Each query: O(m * log n), where m is the length of the query string (due to binary search for each character).
- Space Complexity: O(n + total length of all queries).

## Summary
By preprocessing the positions of each allowed letter and using binary search, we can efficiently check if a query string is a subsequence and determine the minimum number of letters to append to make it unpleasant. The DP array `f` helps quickly answer the minimum extension needed for any suffix of `s`.
